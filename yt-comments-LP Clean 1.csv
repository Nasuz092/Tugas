2024-09-29T07:37:55Z;@Ace-wp7ld;Big fan of both the new songs am looking forward to the full new album. Not gonna lie i was a little skeptical about the change from chester but the band adapted and these songs play to her strengths and they still have the same intensity/heart/genuine sound/feel that the band has always had. The only negative or criticism i have is a few of the live old songs just don’t suit her range/style and may never sound right to some of us older fans who spent half our lives hearing it done a certain way. With all that being said im still a fan wither way the end product is always great from linkin park as a whole from lyrics to instruments and so on that im all for it going forward. 🤘;0

I started to love screaming with Chester, I discovered that even some screams can be comfortable and even liberating, congratulations to LP, Mike is even smarter than I imagined, he got it right The choice of a vocalist surprised me, in fact, I found it strange at first that it was a woman, but the LP, as always, rocks.👏🏽👏🏽;0

2024-09-28T17:29:43Z;@PhoenixStarYT;Losing Chester was definitely not great for Linkin Park, but Emily has proven she has what it takes to really bring new life to the band. It 's clear she isn 't trying to be the new Chester, because she knows that just cannot be done at all. Instead she brings a completely different and new experience to the band, that I think works way better than I could have ever imagined. This sound, this absolutely incredible sound, I could feel in my chest, and it felt extraurdinary. There was so much power here that you can hear from beginning to end.  I 'm excited to see what 's next to come for the new Linkin Park. I 'm sure there is much more incredible stuff that they 're gonna bring to the table, and that Emily is gonna be along for the ride. Keep it up you guys!;0

2024-09-28T17:00:40Z;@Konfide4043;You can tell by the riffs and vocals that this song is hungry. Imagine the weight on the shoulders of LP, bringing it back after having such a legendary singer. Now, they 've struck a fine balance between Meteora and Minutes to Midnight, with an edge. In other words, this song is a banger. Heavy is the Crown 👑;0

2024-09-28T12:38:56Z;@yumeyashin;I 've listened to Linkin Park from around my 13/14 years old to my 16 years old, it helped me through college that was honestly an horrible period for me. Chester was already gone when I started to listen to Linkin Park, but I think I 've possibly seen all the interviews of him that exists on this earth, all the bloopers, funny videos of him and all. At this time I saw him a bit like an older brother that helps you and gives you advices. I cried MANY times thinking about his death, I really grieved his loss even though I didn 't already like him when he died. But he was so human, so kind, it 's not one those celebrities that are kind for their appearance and reputation. You could see he really was someone deeply kind. When I heard Emily for the first time I was angry, feeling like they 've tried to replace Chester. It was like 3 weeks ago. Today I listened again and I cried. It 's been 4 years I don 't listen to Linkin Park anymore but actually I realize that I still miss Chester. I cried because I 'm proud that his friends got up again and continued their passion and their friendship. Haters are stupid because we all know (normal people) that Chester would have been so proud of them as he dealt with pain too. Thanks for that Linkin Park members, Emily too. It 's an honor, not a replacement. I hope people will understand.;1

Chester will be in our hearts forever but you guys want the band to fall apart because he is gone? Ridiculous... Let them continue their dream and let them continue as Linkin Park... Just look at Mike how happy he is during live perfomences... Stop hating and enjoy god damn. It is a heavy crown to be a new leadsinger for Linkin Park... but she is awesome. She. Is. Just. Fuckin. Awesome... Respect to Emily.;496

2024-09-28T15:37:41Z;@starblaiz1986;100%, Chester will be forever missed, but Emily is incredible too. She 's not trying to  'replace ' Chester - she (and the rest of the band) are building on his legacy. He himself said years ago that the band is not just him, and there is no way he would have wanted the music to stop. He will forever be remembered, but that shouldn 't mean not moving forward. She 's clearly got that spark in her, and I can 't wait to hear the full album, given that Emptiness Machine and Heavy Is The Crown are both INCREDIBLE!;16

2024-09-28T09:15:09Z;@samsbookbook3425;So this song is made for the league of legends worlds. A video game where its all about teamplay and sometimes single performance. This song has so many intelligent messages  'this is what you ask for ' --&gt' in terms of the video game its the message of  'thats the price you have to pay for beeing a pro 'in term of emily and linking park  'we are back fans this our performance and my scream ' this is what you asked for. Then we have  'Heavy is the crown ' in terms of the video game its  'sometimes the weight is settled on one or two persons to carry the game ' BUT also if you want to wear the crown you have to carry the weight of the tournament / the games / the fans / the competitors etc ' in terms of linking park --&gt'  'heavy is the crown of replacing chester ' especially for emily as 1:1 replacing but in general for the whole band.

Some memories never fade, no matter how far apart we are now. Even when everything seems lost, some things—like what we shared—never really fade. Some things are just too deeply rooted to let go.

2024-09-27T23:46:17Z;@gerardoramirez115;Unpopular Opinion: This sounds like someone fed an AI the prompt  'Linkin park with a female singer ' and it spit out this subpar imitation.  The problem I find is that they are  'trying ' to sound like Linkin Park while they are objectively not Linkin Park. Personally I would 've much preferred them taking on a new name, and exploring the input that this new singer brings while taking inspiration from their old catalogue. The singer 's stuff from her other band is pretty cool.  Unfortunately i think they are missing on those 2 parts for me. They are trying to sound like Linkin Park and giving us imitation Linkin Park while also objectively not being Linkin Park.  But again... seems like I am in the minority since all I see online is praise that I sincerely do not understand.;3

2024-09-28T01:02:06Z;@detzuh85;​@@gerardoramirez115 I think people (including myself) are ready to evolve and have different perspectives and enjoy different things. It 's not Chester and I 'm sure they understand that. I guarantee Linkin park as a group has put more thought into this than either you or I.;0
2024-09-28T01:18:35Z;@gerardoramirez115;​@@detzuh85 Here 's the problem I find, this is not an evolution. Even if you were to somehow magically replace the singer with Chester for these songs my comment regarding Linkin Park sounding like they 're imitating Linkin Park would remain. Highlighting even further that my issue is not that the new singer is different, but rather that they sound like they 've been put through a filter of genericness. Maybe even to a certain degree sounding like a pop band with a Linkin Park facade. Not an evolution. If they wanted to evolve they 'd change the name and try something new.;0

2024-09-27T23:07:32Z;@ShepMvS;Ill be real honest here... When I first heard her singing...Singing the olds songs..I didnt like it at all. Than this song came out I didnt check it. Lets just listen Meteora and Hybrid Theory again. But halfway through I realised why they chose her! And I hope can still like this new LP without feeling I betrayed Chester liking the new songs. Because actually I do like it.   Also I used to play lol for years , seeing the videoclip is about lol was a nice suprise.;0

2024-09-27T12:52:30Z;@joshkushnir9035;Having grown up listening to Linkin Park and the band influencing my own music, and then my daughter being born during the band’s hiatus period following Chester’s death, she’s now really getting into music and she’s enjoyed what she’s heard of the band’s old material, but we just listened to this song together for the first time and she absolutely loved it, especially with the new singer also being a girl.  It’s like my era ended and she gets to start with a new one. Wonderful.  Keep creating and inspiring, LP.  ❤;2
2024-09-27T12:49:35Z;@majinkhaos8196;He would 've loved this ❤;1
2024-09-27T12:48:46Z;@AngelPerie;I kinda like this song, it reminds me of an old LP =) But I can 't stop hearing this nasty scratch in Emily 's voice. Especially after screaming. It sounds like she  's doing it wrong.;0
2024-09-27T13:03:26Z;@kokoro212;Maybe she 's doing it on purpose, it 's typical style of death metal or heavy metal like matt shadow from avenge sevenfold. Chester screanging(scream + singing) use higher throat near the nose, heavy metal use middle or deeper throat. I heard that Mike chose her because she 's not trying to copy Chester 's style. He has another plan I assume. Emily is Emily it seems.;0
2024-09-27T15:03:51Z;@AngelPerie;@@kokoro212 I 'm not trying to say that she is better or worse than Chester, she 's different and I like it, but I 'm worried about her voice. If it 's just me so no problem. I would glad to hear the full album with her.;0

2024-09-27T13:05:22Z;@megilacuttyjones735;Some of us aren 't here for their personal lives. Some just wanna hear music. If she 's so bad then eventually karma will get to her...but idk so far she seems decent considering the band likes her. Ashton Kutcher and Mia Kunis also were friends and supported Danny Masterson even more than Emily did. Emily already disowned her past friendship with him when she found out about the type of charges...i guess.   But like I said as long as she 's not touching kids like lost prophets old singer I dont really care what religion she has.;0

That 's like deciding to make an entire new business and shutting down the old one just to enter a new department😂 honestly these haters have no idea what they are on about, and if they actually cared about the band they 'd respect this decision. Emily is not chester, she isn 't here to replace him. Her voice is amazing and sounds amazing. She is super talented and deserves so much praise for doing as well as she is. No, she isn 't chester... so what? As sad as it is, chester is dead, and he can 't sing for the band anymore. There is no fair point of comparison here.  Love all the way to emily.❤❤;0

2024-09-27T04:10:36Z;@boblawblaw6185;I actually don 't  remember anyone asking for this, to dig up the legacy of a band from its grave because its missing one of its core members. you know the people who asked for this? greedy record execs.  This is like the Jackson 5 calling themselves the jackson 5 and replacing michael with janet, no, latoya.  This is like Nirvana not renaming themselves Foo fighters  after  Kurt 's passing   What this  IS Like is the shameless motown acts trying to replace dying members because they didn 't manage their money correctly during their hay day so they have to tour as a shadow of themselves.   REVIVING Linkin Park, is fine... AS SOMETHING ELSE not named Linkin Park. You could have even named  the new band after an old song or album so it is still tied to the original band, but you simply replace the front man  and call it the same thing, Then adding the political dynamic of it being a woman  is just vile and reeks of trying to farm some ESG score instead of doing this out of love.   You COULD have even gotten away with it by using an AI version of Chester on songs that were unfinished, unreleased that CLEARLY sounded like they were written while he was alive or had him in mind ( like This one). Instead this comes across as trying to Mandela Effect him out of all the old songs that put the band on the map.   Emily should have been used only for new songs and not on any  'nostalgia  ' tracks(Like This one) . I 'm tired of corporate sh*tbags using nostalgia as a weapon because they  DON 'T KNOW  how to find anyone making something new that 's worth while. Everything since 2015 as been  Remastered,   genderswap,  gay swap, Rebooted.... WHERE THE  F**K IS NEW AND ORIGINAL ?;0

2024-09-27T00:44:03Z;@proxyysellz;the odds are not really likely, just by her being a good singer! she has great breath control, so a vocalist that can already control breath so well will be able to do it even live!  pitch correction doesn’t really work on screams either, since they aren’t really a “pitch”, i hope this helped 🙏🏻🖤.;2

2024-09-26T23:46:52Z;@thatguy5233;i 'm pretty sure this 15s scream everyone is commenting about is edited. her voice is fading out too smoothly and the voice vibration feels too smooth too. i personally don 't care at all if it is or not tho. i think she 's an amazing singer and i 'm just happy the band is making music again.  'this is what i asked for ' you could say;0
2024-09-27T00:47:22Z;@proxyysellz;it’s definitely unedited! i’m just saying due to it being a little too unobvious.  because no matter what you do, you can edit something as much as you want, but it’ll never feel “real” you know? she’s done it live already so we know it’s possible!  i know you weren’t hating but i just wanted to let you and possibly others know, since not everyone has engineered or mastered before!  it’s actually also not severe mixing on the track, it’s highly compressed just to sound like a rock song, but other than that it’s actually a really well rounded mix of rawness and technology :-);1

2024-09-26T23:32:53Z;@helenaribeiro0225;This to me isn 't Linking Park anymore. Linking Park was Chester, period. Even when he was alive they wanted to replace him for a female singer and he was devastated with it.  Yeah, her voice is great, but to me, LP died with Chester, this is just a cheap copy.  I would have respected them more if they created a  'new ' band, like many other bands did when the core member passed away. I would probably even buy their stuff, but, not like this. If they did  'Linkin Park feat Emily ' I would have no problem with that. Like this it seems like they are either to cash out on the fame that they got, because of Chester 's vocals, or trying to erase his legacy. What set LP apart, to me, was Chester 's voice! Without it, it 's just noise and yet another mediocre band going around.  Emily deserves fame, absolutely, but because of her talent and not because she 's attached to LP. She deserves her own band, not what remains of a once amazing band.;0
2024-09-26T23:45:21Z;@themarsalien;I absolutely agree but this isn’t a replacement for Chester, this is a new era. At first I felt the same way, I was also mad that they “replaced Rob the drummer” but now I’ve learned that Linkin Park is changing and I’ve come to accept it. There’s no replacing Chester and that’s why they’re not, they’re just adding new members and starting a new phase of the band. One day you’ll also move on and accept this or you can stop following what they do, but I know for sure I’ll keep up with their new music because it sounds amazing!;3
2024-09-26T23:56:13Z;@helenaribeiro0225;@@themarsalien Perhaps when I hear her sing new stuff instead of songs that were sang by Chester and that touched the teenager that I was back then and that helped me express myself. That 's probably why hearing  'Numb ' sang by her sounds wrong to me. It;0

2024-09-26T22:31:01Z;@superultraturbomegadoombos9077;Still waiting for this new evolution/ sound that they are supposed to be taking, that im supposed to get on board with.   I listened to the band evolve their sound for over 2 decades, these new tracks sound like a return to hybrid theory/meteora with a shittier singer.   I 'm losing faith that this new ablum will actually impress at all.;1

2024-09-26T22:18:35Z;@ModrasNeo;I like to believe that the chorus is a reminder of Emily to herself when some people hate her, hate the fact that she 's the new voice of LP and hate that the band decided to move on without Chester and Rob...She said  'yes ' when Mike and the other guys asked her to join the band, so this is what she ask for...and heavy is the crown, Chester 's legacy... she has to fight now, to demostrate that she 's worth. And she 's doing very well, the 15 seconds scream spits facts.;0

2024-09-26T18:14:21Z;@LeonLego;Geez... This is the Linkin Park sound that I am looking for. The instruments and Mike 's rap, it feels like listening again to Hybrid Theory or Meteora albums. The only weird to me is the female vocalist, her voice is like toning the voice of Chester. I can imagine Chester 's voice in this song but sadly, he 's gone. This is a good song, I really miss Chester 's voice.;0

2024-09-26T17:02:30Z;@OscarBenben;The song is very good, we can certainly feel that Shinoda 's touch.  Thumbs up if you agree with the following: The thing is: they should change the Linkin Park name. In every other band when such a leader dies, even if they want to keep doing music they move to newer projects. Would you imagine a Metallica without James Hatfield ? Would you imagine an Avenged Sevenfold without M. Shadows ? ACDC without Angus Young now that Malcolm passed away ?  Impossible right ?  It 's the same here. Nothing wrong about the song or album 's quality and nothing wrong about continuing in making music together guys, but you should baptise the band with a different name. Linking Park was with Chester. Now it 's a different project, and, different project = different name. That 's my opinion, but congrats, this song really kicks a** you nailed it guys !;1

2024-09-26T16:05:20Z;@jordanmiller7945;I dunno man I still do not like her. The scream was not that great imo....... That 's just how I feel about it. This song is decent and does sound like some of their older stuff but let 's just be real here she isn 't that great at screaming. It 's very rare that a woman can come anywhere close to a man on that. She 's just so quiet there no emotion to it, it just sounds like she 's doing karaoke somewhere and did a good job for a drink chick on a Friday night.   She of course is nowhere even in the same universe as Chester. Talk about disrespecting one of the men that helped you get to where you are today. They shouldn 't changed the name of the band out of respect because no matter how good their melody sounds nobody will ever scream like Chester did.   I also find it intriguing that she is a scientologist. Interesting choice considering Chester 's  'suicide ' came right as him and several others who committed 'suicide ' we 're about to unveil the PDFs they had encountered during their career which is exactly the kind of people that scientologists are. The second you try to leave them or go against them they release all the dirty stuff you did with them or they kill you off of that won 't work.   To me putting her in the band, keeping the name the same, and then having her sing Chester 's songs at her debut was insanely disrespectful imo and Chester 's son feels exactly the same way.   They could be a decent band still all that aside but they are NOT Linkin park anymore and at this point there 's just spitting on a better man 's legacy.  Please overlook the typos. Swipe has it 's moments. Hope everyone has a great day;0

2024-09-26T15:09:03Z;@cullynplaysbass;Since Minutes to Midnight. I have checked out from Linkin Park. That was the last album I purely enjoyed.   I just listened to this song two times in a row, and then The Emptiness Machine. Heavy is the Crown sounds like something right off of Meteora which is unarguably the best Linkin Park album, and The Emptiness Machine sounds like a Hybrid Theory track.  What does this mean?? Well back to Linkin Park roots. We need a Linkin Park album like this right now. Chester Bennington was legendary in the same way all of the OG Linkin Park members are to this band, but Emily Armstrong is an incredible choice to carry the torch and her voice sits well within their mix.  If you argue that Chesters vocal spot in the band should have died with Chester, then you probably have no idea what it truly means to be an artist/musician.;1

2024-09-26T14:47:54Z;@nashtebelak466;It 's a new chapter in LP 's story.  Everyone who says she isn 't the fit or that LP shouldn 't be back needs a reality check.  If you don 't like the music, you don 't have to listen, but don 't attack a group but you don 't feel the same vibes.  Chester was amazing, but we all have to come to terms that he has passed on.  That chapter is done, a new one has started.  If you 're a real fan of LP and of music in general, you 'd understand that we need to understand this, that not everything will last forever and to make every second count while you have it.  I grew up on LP and will now be able to listen to them again, maybe even has my kids grow up with it too.;0

2024-09-26T08:41:05Z;@michaelwidener9385;I appreciate the music. It 's good, but i feel like chester not being here... just leaves a hole. The music is great tho but i feel like i cant listen to linkin park without him. It feels weird 😕 chester was linkin park. Im not hating on emily at all. But i miss chester because i feel like his lyrics were deeper. Emily is very talented. But she will never be chester. Im not trying to come off as a hater. Im not hating the music and i dont mind change but when it comes to replacing a legend like chester, that there is no right way to do it. And that 's not emilys fault. She is very talented and has a powerful voice. i just miss chester. He got me through my own battles mentally. Idk how to feel about this i will give it some time to sit with me but this is a difficult adjustment for me. But i wish the best for LP;0

2024-09-26T07:15:11Z;@JimiWFaith;This has so much meaning... Heavy is The Crown for Emily to fill the lead singer positiion, dealing with HUGE expectatiions, the bar SO high, and dealing with so much criticism and people who hate on her for thinking she 's replacing Chester, instead of someone who has her own identity and is giving everything as a new member... It 's the same for the band with every new album ever since Minutes to Midnight with people stuck on the Hybrid Theory and Meteora sound....   'Today 's gonna be the day you notice  'Cause I 'm tired of explainin ' what the joke is ' Like, tired of explaining that... And a  'This is what you asked for ', filled with that bottled up rage... Matching a  'Given Up ' scream, ang giving  'SHUT UP ' vivbes from  'A Plece For My Head '... This what you wanted and asked for it for so long, HERE YOU GO, YOU CAN SHUT UP NOW...   'Fire in the sunrise, ashes rainin ' down Try to hold it in, but it keeps bleedin ' out ' For me is like Chester 's ashes are there raining with every brand new day... And a wound that you try to put a brave face, but still hurts...  This is FIRE... 🔥;1

2024-09-26T04:21:45Z;@_Gia_8092;This is the worst Worlds song ever. Warrior 2014 was ten thousand times better. The art quality is terrible, you could call it disgusting. Everyone looks the same, except for the hair color. The singing doesn 't sound like singing, it 's like screaming into the listener 's ear. The entire MV focuses on Linkin Park and has nothing to do with LoL or T1. This MV looks more like a debut song from Linkin Park's new album than a song for Worlds 2024. Pentakill's rock is much better than Linkin Park 's but Riot decided to ignore it, great.;
 Surely Linkin Park wouldn 't be happy to be chosen as the Worlds 2024 theme song because the MV is surprisingly short; screaming into the ear and then stopping halfway; it 's terrible.;
 If this song was performed at the opening of Worlds 2024;" it would be a human disaster. Trash""";12;

Et de deux, et l 'album est déjà précommandé :D  Autant les reprises des anciennes chansons, écrites par et pour Chester, chantées par Emily lors des live c 'était sans plus (ça fait bizarre, et sa voix était tellement unique) Autant les nouvelles écrites autour et adaptées à cette nouvelle voix fonctionnent très bien. Certains estiment que LP sans Chester n 'est plus LP, je peux le comprendre. Mais l 'âme de LP est toujours là, Mike y participe aussi (quand même !). Et Emily, sans aucune idée de  'remplacer ' Chester, est un très bon choix pour ouvrir une nouvelle ère.;0

2024-09-25T22:15:19Z;@odoacro11;Thank you so much for this! We are very grateful for your pivotal collaboration with Riot in LOL Worlds 2024. The best Worlds songs in my book...and we had some real bangers these years. Emily is amazing! Wish you all the best!;0

2024-09-25T22:13:55Z;@adamtorok8740;LP after meteora is a disappointment. LP with the new singer is a disappointment. Or maybe LP is the same and I changed a lot... God knows... I dont listen them anymore.;0

2024-09-25T22:01:39Z;@mesv3567;i love that LP is coming back to its roots and i hope this is not just a bait song to  'make it big ' due to league of legends and instead they continue to tread this path, i hated  'the new linkin park ' we had at the end of the last LP phase, i love and i miss Chester but i don 't miss what LP turned into, bands can change and experiment but imo they should always make at least 10% of the songs dedicated to the consumers that supported and made them famous while playing one genre and one style.;0

2024-09-25T19:00:56Z;@durelljfg5217;The lyric “This is what you asked for, heavy is the crown” feels like it was almost tailor-made for Emily, as it reflects both the weight of her new role and her journey from fan to frontwoman. It’s a continuation of the authenticity that defines Linkin Park’s style—expressing real, often intense emotions that resonate with listeners because they come from a very personal place.;1

And the atmosphere in Hamburg, the band and people were so great that I just got my tickets for Paris...   For all who cannot move on see what they 're are - friends who make really great music which bring so many people together - keep on listening to the old songs with Chesters voice like we all do as well. But stop to decline that this is still Linkin Park, she 's the new singer and how they evolved to a great new version...   Mike already told  'It 's not about the talent, it 's about the person ' and maybe you 'll open your heart to accept her as the amazing part of this band as she is...;1

2024-09-25T16:29:50Z;@SolanumX;The best way I can describe these full body goosebumps im feeling while I listen to this' I 'd never thought i 'd feel those from Linkin Park again after that day' and im happy to be proven wrong. Chester to me is a somber yet peaceful area in my mind despite the surrounding chaos, a place I lived in for years as a youth and he helped me make it a place to recover mentally from the world. A place where we could discover ourselves, to gain and find new strength to then be able to face whatever opposed us. When he passed It may sound silly but I started to question everything about my existence and despite tears welling up just thinking about it' it still feels like he is with us, a part of us, and because of his strength to carry our burdens and teaching us to stand against, we have to carry on that legacy. At the end with the synth it feels like a sunset with the ghostly outline of the flag bearer from hybrid theory in the dusty landscape from the In the End  video and the horizon is blank just like this new canvas for LP. No one can replace Chester' but we can keep his spirit alive of saying no. Saying I wont take this. Screaming from your soul at the pain and heartache of even just existing sometimes, and I wish you luck LP ❤ Thank you for making this and now we got the 15+ second scream we 've waited years to hear again' As a drummer I feel like once Colin stretches his legs some more I feel like you guys are on the way to something good and please continue ❤;0

I 'm so glad they are continuing on...Emily singing old LP songs is just part of the job and her passion in those songs makes them LP.;0
2024-09-25T16:37:45Z;@savagewraith;@De4d4TheRest  I would say it 's one of the few cases where not separating the art from the artist is valid considering how it conflicts with the late-Chester 's life/struggle.  While I am able to separate the art from the artist, prime example is As I L;0

2024-09-25T14:34:42Z;@winstonsworld9236;I feel like the lyrics  'this is what you asked for, heavy is the crown ' is the new linkin park basically saying this is our new album and it 's heavy. Responding to negative feedback from the last few albums, especially one more light. Also noticed they not playing any songs from one more light on the tour except for friendly fire, which itself wasn 't on the album.;0
2024-09-25T14:53:39Z;@elyonne9770;Actually this is written for LoL Worlds Competition,  which featured last year 's winning team.

I like your interpretation and meaning of the song for Linkin Park though, which is also quite fitting, but just thought I 'll share some context too!;0
2024-09-25T18:18:56Z;@Assassin.9958;Buddy, neither this or the last song were “heavy” AT ALL, have you never heard actual heavy music in your life? They literally put out 2 of the most basic sounding alt rock songs with simple melodies &amp' short/simple song structure like it’s made for the radio lol;1

2024-09-25T14:27:33Z;@M.Mitchell;SO WEIRD!  When Chester was alive, during rehearsals for the <b>One More Light</b> live shows, there’s a video where he sings the song <b>Heavy</b> in a nu-metal style, with screams and raps. But Mike Shinoda didn’t seem to agree at all, he even called Chester a  'kid '. Now, with the new singer and the new single, the band is back to rock and Mike is rapping again. It’s really strange, it feels like a contradiction. Mike Shinoda comes off as really hypocritical and manipulative.;2
2024-09-25T16:49:22Z;@gk8257;Lol thst never happened.  They played a nu metal version with Mike who also contributed,  so it 's not like he didn 't agree? And then said  'give the kids what they want ' meaning the fans. Chester then repeated what Mike said.   Stop.trying to change the narrative it 's weird how ppl just want to start a smear campaign like this.;0

2024-09-25T14:19:10Z;@lucasalmeida8518;I 'm not going to be a hypocrite, when it was announced that Emily was joining the band, I was disappointed, it would never be on par with Chester, until I heard this song, I think everyone who thought the same way as me were root Linkin Park fans, still hurt by the lack of Chester, his legacy. Congratulations to Emily for making me realize that no one will ever be like Chester, but his legacy is in good hands and Emily doesn 't need to be like him, but honor what he did and wanted her own journey, chase an even bigger one. The crown is heavy, it is difficult to feel the weight of being the best. My biggest congratulations to the band and thanks to Emily for bringing back the essence of Linkin Park.;518
2024-09-25T15:15:25Z;@MegaKinking;I first heard that song this morning while watching the video clip from league of legend, I didn 't put much though on the lyric at first, because it seem related mostly to the league champion final, but then your comment made me realize it also can very apply to the band itself. The crown must be indeed very heavy to weight for Emily right now. But mostly, what i love in your comment, and that I hope more people understand it, its : Emily doesn 't need to be like him.;20

But the band deserves to come back to do what they love. And they honored the their friend no matter what. They deserve to come back again. No one is getting replaced.

2024-09-25T12:55:18Z;@LilPinez;The song is massive - no question. But unfortunately the studio sounds quite  'overproduced ' to me. Have a look at the live version (watch?v=cSHAEXlOgAs), its a banger. Her presence is insane there, she sounds so raw. It 's been on loop for days, but listening to the studio version now doesn 't give me half as much. Just to much audio effects here imo. Kind of a wasted opportunity. Nevermind, still on repreat and hopefully they will release a live version as well 🙌;0

Chester is credited as the songwriter on most on the LP stuff and his absence is quite clear.  That 's why I agree and why I now consider the remainder of this  'band ' to be Mike 's solo project.;1

2024-09-25T14:43:57Z;@Abbice;She is good, but for some old vocal parts that is not enough. Still there are not many vocalists to take Chester parts live. And, as Mike said, its all about chemistry in the band, not just performance.;29

2024-09-28T07:19:05Z;@lolsniperftw4678;The way I see it, Mike is talking to Emily during his verses  'You can 't win if your white flags out when the war begins '    'Should have bit your tongue, theres no turning back this path ' about how hard it will be to deal with this newfound fame she has, and to live up to the legacy of linkin park. And I think  'this is what you asked for ' is a double meaning, obv what you said but also Emily talking to herself about how she accepted to be the new lead singer, now she has to deal with living up to it. heavy is the crown, is the obvious metaphor of Emily accepting such a huge offer of being the new lead singer, but also dealing with having to live up to the legacy of the band. Brilliant, and the most linkin park way to come back.;1

I would just not liking it if song as a whole was mediocre, but it is what it is.  Just in case, I’ve listened LP almost two decades already, so this band is not new for me, so u can save ur time on that if want to disagree with my opinion.;1

It 's very much on Riot games for causing all the anger in the actual promo video though, for not clearly targetting the correct fanbase in their video.

2024-09-25T09:54:37Z;@dragulamcfeisty199;This was good. This was better. Also, you can 't protect the new lead singer forever. When you introduce someone new especially when they replacing someone as epic as Chester, you intro them with a bang. TF is up with the under 3min songs?? You pulling an Ice Spice on us?? Either you confident in her or don 't bother debuting her. PS. The Emptiness Machine sucked balls. Papercut, Crawling and Somewhere I Belong level songs should be released cos those songs made Linkin Park. Think it over!;0

2024-09-25T09:51:42Z;@AmericanGTS;Jealous of the parallel universe that is hearing their Chester’s second original song with his first 17 second scream.;0
2024-09-25T09:51:35Z;@cobusvanderlinde6871;Great song.  Before we get into some thoughts I 'm having, let me be clear: Emily is doing a great job, and I am excited to see how things proceed for Linkin Park from here onwards.  That out of the way. I heard an audible gasp for air at the end of the long scream... so on a second listen I 've confirmed that there are at least 4 such sounds in this recording. Given circumstances, comparisons are inevitable... so: Chester 's breathing tends to be less obtrusive, not perfect by any means, for example there 's a nasty gasp in  'New Divide ' and that 's just off the top of my head, but I am unaware of a song with him with this many gasps this loud (there are two small ones in  'Given Up ').  Now... is this Emily 's fault? Maybe, but it could also be the recording studio or editing.  I am not exhaustively familiar with especially the newer albums so maybe One More Light is even worse, and it would demonstrably not be Emily.  Then regarding the recent Live performances with Emily, I caught two cases where she steals a breath in a line that Chester sang on one breath (one in  'Numb ' and one in  'What I 've Done '' also a fair bit of gasping in the  'What I 've Done ' I 'm chalking it up to being tired towards the end of the show).  I doubt many singers could match the force of nature that was Chester Bennington, and even fewer could do so while singing in this sort of style, so this would certainly not be a disqualifying failure on Emily 's part, but I do think it shows room for improvement, either for her personally or for the band as a whole. This has also given me a new level of appreciation for Chester.  I am eager to see the future of Linkin Park.;0
2024-09-25T10:09:49Z;@danielgil1359;the gasp of air is intentionally added and not edited out and made it audible. it made the song even more cool;0

2024-09-25T08:27:02Z;@linkinfan1grys450;When I heard  'Heavy is the crown ', I felt transported back to my childhood when LP music helped me get through a tough time. It 's somehow both nostalgic and something new. There are a lot of references to old albums and songs. As I said in another post, the theme of their comeback is Kintsugi. They are not removing the cracks, they are patching them up with gold - the new members are that kind of gold.;
 All the haters need to realize that they are in the minority and that their hate will not stop this great comeback. I am glad there will be a new generation of LP fans and I hope their music will help them like it has helped me.;;;

2024-09-25T07:52:09Z;@derekgardin1512;Well I look at it the other way.  The other band members all had to put their careers on hold for 7 YEARS because of a decision CB made for HIMSELF that day.  I agree with them moving on and they definitely waited enough time.  If they did it after 7 months would be one thing.  Apparently Emily has been working with them behind the scenes for a long while now.  Which is obvious since they put together an album;1
2024-09-25T13:40:14Z;@DerDarkfire1;@@derekgardin1512  You started your comment with  'I look at it the other way. '  Which implicates that you would disagree with me.  And then you follow that statement up with a lot of explanation, why you agree with me.  Sounds confusing to me to be hone;0

2024-09-25T05:53:50Z;@AndrewMai;Now THIS sounds like Linkin Park (more so than Emptiness Machine)  Mike 's angsty rap, heavy guitar riffs, balanced with good mixing from mr Hahn, and of course Emily 's screaming. Reminiscent of Meteora. This put a big smile on my face :);1

You 've got a long way to go to break down these childhood walls and let you back to the depths of the pit where I banish my scars.   I will warm up to her im sure, but she 's got to scream and sing with the tone of inner pain and anguish. She cant just sing words and scream because its her job. She has to find her inner demons and scars of the past, rip them open and scream because of the mental anguish she 's going through and thats the only way she can release it.... she has to sing like she 's given up/giving in.. she 's good, but she 's missing the tone, the emotion. Find a kid raised in a struggling home, single mother and down on himself. Ask him if he feels like her emotion is sincere, they 'll know the tone you 're looking for. Bring that kid into the studio to fine tune her voice and then you will have made LP into its next form.;1

With all that said, no one in the world has a chance in hell of replacing or duplicating Chester, just can 't be done. Much like the beyond talented Freddie Mercury . Both their voices are awesome once in a lifetime, one in a billion,  embodiment of talent. Emily 's a good singer and fits well with the band,  but she 'll never be Chester Bennington. So,  good job Emily I look forward to the upcoming material, but the Linkin Park that 's in my heart will always be headed by Chester Bennington .;0

Emily is not replacing Chester. She came as a much needed part of Linkin Park. In the new songs written exclusively for her, she can sing to keep the linkin park taste.

2024-09-25T03:26:18Z;@megilacuttyjones735;Cmon...shes not replacing Chester. Its why they got a female lead. They still want that LP sound but they needed a lead singer to cover Chesters parts but also write new material without it being exactly likr Chester. I cant really explain it but i think they did everything they can to show us theyre not replacing Chester but just starting a new chapter with a new member;1

2024-09-25T03:16:25Z;@boblawblaw6185;real talk. I played this , then I went to the first Song with chester I felt crown most resembled and played  'Bleed it out ' . Bleed it out had my tapping my foot and headbanging before the first bars. This doesn 't even compare to what he did and its very obvious this is a bunch of corporate suits behind this trying to squeeze a few more drops of blood out of the band 's legacy. This is why they had to also partner with such a mindless brand like league of legends. A user base that has been cultivated into being parroting followers. You won 't be able to tell the difference between bots and League of Legends players who listened to Linkin park only after Chester 's passing. And they will bury the honest criticisms like yours and mine.  At least the record execs behind foo fighters had the decency to rename the band when  Kurt Cobain passed. This generation of director and C level blood suckers are shameless.;0

2024-09-25T03:25:25Z;@boblawblaw6185;this is nothing like faint. its closer to  bleed it out  in tempo and tone,  and that 's being generous.  This doesn 't even hold a candle to that song. The moment the song opens up its adrenaline pumping. The writing and repetitiveness in Crown sound more like a filler track from minutes to midnight which is probably the least listened to album. Her voice is no where near as engaging and haunting as Chesters. The lyrics are no where near as gut punching. Most people can 't relate to joining scientology because most people wouldn 't be that silly to walk into a cult like that  in the first place.;0
2024-09-25T03:26:33Z;@boblawblaw6185;@@hdjdjdbdbosnfbfvdvd9543 expect a lot of botted comments and views hyping this up from now until when the album comes out . I can already smell the record company throwing all the resources they use to make industry plants at this.;0

2024-09-25T02:53:26Z;@megilacuttyjones735;Right now it is. She 's literally now the biggest female rock lead. And she has to deal with Chester/LP fans. It seems like many are starting to really like her and realize she 's not a replacement...she 's a new member helping the rest of Linkin Park not die out. I miss Chester Bennington but it 's not fair to the other guys to have no more career. I think they took a female lead so fans won 't think they 're trying to replace Chester;0

2024-09-25T03:05:35Z;@freyoleitfus;I’m so happy about this to be honest, cause I gave her unconditional support since day one, as I could feel the right energy in her performances to fit the group. The album will be a massive release and the tour will be too. And what I love about this return to scenes is that, at least so far, they demonstrated that it is not about money, but it is about doing music and performing.  I have very high hopes about the album, but after many years I’d be probably already satisfied with these two singles.   Not that I didn’t appreciate the last albums, but my LP flame took fire with the first albums, and the late switch to pop never really convinced me. The Hunting Party was such a complicated album to listen by being 17, that I started to appreciate it just now. And the rest were another thing.  This to say that the guys I really don’t think they will tour for money, but primarily to satisfy their need for having a stage as a way to let out all of what they have inside, would it be accumulated or recent.  Long life to LP;1

The first single didn 't convince me, and with all the controversy surrounding Emily, the band, Chester, Chester 's family, etc. Its been difficult to just tune that all out, and try to appreciate the music. But this song made me forget all that noise for a moment. The song had me half expectimg to hear Chester come in at the end or something. That 's high praise from me at least.;2

I think I really like the blending of her and Mike, as they are so different.  This will be the first LP album I purchase and if they come through my area, I 'll be there!;0

I also hope Ron Perlman and Pete Davidson also return to voice Optimus Primal and Mirage.  And if they decide to help find Bumblebee’s voice, hope Dylan O’ Brien returns to voice Bee from Bumblebee (2018)    Also, will Linkin Park returns to write new original songs with their new lead singer frontwoman Emily Armstrong? I really hope they do soon if they want to 🤘🏽, because without them, there would be no Transformers film.  I know it’ll probably be taking place in the ‘90s, but can LP make it sound like the 90s vibes though?;0

About the lyrics i like the rap part but you gave Emily like 3 different lines, her part is a bit repetitive, it could have be nice to give her a verse also but maybe its cause of Riot who asked to cut a part to make a 3min less song.;2

2024-09-25T00:00:20Z;@JGE_DK;When  'The Emptiness Machine ' was released, I was convinced that Emily was the right choice. 😃 Now I 'm ABSOLUTELY 100% CONVINCED!!!! 🥰 Dear Emily. If you see / read / hear this : Yes, I 'm being honest for a moment. When the news were revealed, that LP were reuniting, I was one of  'them '. I was hoping for  'a new Chester ', knowing very well that we 'd never get someone like Chester again. But the rumors buzzed - and the day came. The day where it was revealed to the world, that we didn 't get a new Chester - but instead we got YOU - The One and Only Emily!!!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰;1

2024-09-25T05:54:44Z;@taureanmills8414;​@@py16667Agreed, This is mainstream trendy rock, And I cant get down with this whiny crap! I 'm done, I won 't waste my time going back and forth with everyone over this.LP is over for me and this new trendy crap isn 't my style. I 'll just hold on to the memories and the hardcore sounds of the first 2 Albums (And pieces of the 3rd) and call it a Lifetime w LP!   R.I.P Chester Bennington! You left us far too soon brotha! 🙏🏿 🤘🏿😥🤘🏿;0
2024-09-24T23:12:31Z;@DOCDOCFLAMINGOS;Im sorry...... BUT why in the Hell didn 't you lead  with this as the first single?!?!

2024-09-24T22:48:53Z;@JamCie;I don’t give a f**k what anybody says, I‘m just happy Linkin Park is back. This brought up so many memories. Being a little kid, blasting Meteora in the car, my parents in the front seats and me and my brother in the back or sitting alone in the schoolbus, earphones in, my mp3 player at max volume, blocking out the noise and staring out the window. Both best and worst times of my life, this music always helped me vent whatever was going on. This just has the same insane vibe Linkin Park always had for me.  The crown is heavy, but you’re still wearing it, head held high! 🤘❤️‍🔥;1

I 'm not down for any real or implied anti-therapy vibes from an alleged Scientologist, but SO FAR I haven 't seen ANYTHING from the Emily Armstrong that has been singing for Linkin Park that invalidates or lessens the importance of people 's mental health.

2024-09-24T22:00:37Z;@bogdanmoldovan4806;Thank you, Emily, for being a part of this amazing band that I grew up with! Thank you, Linkin Park! Please never stop doing what you love! I am right there with you guys wherever this journey will lead us! I will carry Chester with me in my heart for the rest of my life and I would love for this band to go on for at least one day more than eternity!  Emily, please keep going on, no matter what the world may say. I don 't want to use the word  'fan ' so true friends of this band will agree that we 'll be there with you always. I started listening to Linkin Park from animated music videos (AMVs) based on Naruto a long time ago. I felt happy and sad with this band, I grieved with it and now I get to see this band start from zero...I am grateful to everyone involved in their success and especially I am grateful to Linkin Park for being a part of my life.;4
2024-09-25T03:14:47Z;@freyoleitfus;I didn’t believe Chester, cause he was my childhood and my teenage, but after 7 years and after coming back with two singles having this magnitude, I can’t see LP without Emily to be honest.  I’ve loved my whole life Evanescence too, so I am just so happy she became the vocalist of my favourite band ever.  Respect till the last breath to Chester, but we all should acknowledge that they decided to go on with the project, even if with a different configuration.  I’m happy for them to be honest, just imagine how difficult the moment itself could have been, and how long it took to recover from it. And the bravery to come back in this way. Just wow.;0

2024-09-24T21:32:58Z;@ginomazzenga4409;Everyone it just sounds like a typical screamo girl vocal type. Nothing special. This is not linkin park. F Scientology. Stop being nice and reject sub par media. They are sprinkling old Linkin park sound tropes in to make it seem more relevant to people’s nostalgia. This isn’t Chester or a singer that can hold the heavy crown and just a singer that’s part of the empty machine.;0

2024-09-27T22:30:42Z;@nemesis6486;​@@pinkumiilku 16.63s in studio version, 12s live in Hamburg debut, 15s live in O2 London. I have a feeling they purposely not let the scream get over 17s to show respect for the late Chester, and I can understand why.  But you 're saying she 's trying to tear Chester down? I guess when you dislike somebody enough you can made up all kinds of sht to suit your narrative...but go off.;0

2024-09-26T06:38:16Z;@austinmartinez8541;I absolutely agree it needs more attention, instead of just an accent. At least it needs to be a little louder or play more throughout the song.

2024-09-24T21:25:41Z;@compsolt;Have not listened to this yet as I am at work but just the title brought a tear to my eye thinking of what It could mean . I am super sad one of the most diverse voices in the world is gone. At the same time super happy to have my favorite band back and I think Emily is killing it for the shoes she has to fill. Funny enough I had just watched a tv show days before the release and announcement that included her old or other bands weatherman  song .Not to get all preachy but It sure seems like an awfully huge coincidence that stuff like this happens . Especially when someone needs that meaning in their life.;0

Yes, Chester was incredible and talented in his own right. But Linkin Park can still be Linkin Park and sound just as good without Chester. But there is no Linkin Park without Mike Shinoda. I 'm not sure how the band 's dynamics work but it seems that way.;1

2024-09-24T20:59:50Z;@wanato614;the song is good. her voice not. the scream quality is medium. normal vocal fry technique  everybody can do this with 2 days practice. no power . for people who love mid class is it okay. the name of the band is the push.;2
2024-09-24T21:14:05Z;@C00lpenguin5;Right, especially that big scream it sounds painful. It sounds off. I do think this song sounds really good live though, but studio version something doesn 't sound right with the vocals.;1

And in tbe studio version it feels like it only goes slightly higher while still maintaining the growly low singing. I think she should 've done what she does live for the studio version!

I don 't want ever to forget the moment I see my fav rock band since my teenage years to reborn into something new without forgetting it 's past legacy. I see everything in the lyrics, the heavy burden, the fear of loss and rejection for daring to go out of it 's bounds. The weight of carrying that logo where heavy feelings is brought outside of our bodies and souls. I was losing hope on ever seeing this live dense atmosphere again, but you gave my heart a new light, a new sun. Welcome aboard Emily Armstrong!;0

2024-09-24T20:45:52Z;@vbi_kun;I like the song. I love her overall sound, but what I miss is the emotion in the screams. They are so stale. Now of course that may be because you can 't mimic the pain and sadness that Chester had with vocal talent alone, but yeah... that 's why I like the new songs, but I can 't listen to her song the old ones.;0
2024-09-24T21:02:03Z;@py16667;Not hearing “emotion” in screams is a very weird &amp' vague criticism, my take is she’s not using any real screaming technique &amp' has no range with it when it comes to tone, whereas many other female vocalists have technique &amp' range with their screams;0

2024-09-24T20:37:00Z;@EuphoricBanana;Absolutely insane! Nothing gets me more excited these days then a new Linkin Park song;0
2024-09-24T20:36:59Z;@theDegausser;The fact that she screamed that note for the <b>exact same 16 seconds</b> that Chester did in Given Up is pretty cool as a callback and tribute to him that sounds like it 's this part of the new Linkin Park 's formula. Really cool subtleties and nods to nostalgia and the old LP, now with a new, pretty great singer (Chester always the GOAT though, RIP, you deserve peace now after this life was so cruel to you, especially early on). Love this MUCH more than the first from the new album!!!;29

2024-09-24T21:10:04Z;@SonGohan-gh1yl;Nah you’re right, most of their fans see anything they do as revolutionary. I actually quite like the new songs but they are incredibly basic, with simple song structure, simple melodies, &amp' kinda generic, but none of that is new for LP anyway;0

I like the fact of the electronic riff sounds along the whole song keeping the harmony among that modern bridges, makes the song very compact and the final breakdown with the Emily 's scream is the cherry on top.

2024-09-24T19:56:50Z;@bhatnagaraki;I don 't know. I read through the comment section and my thoughts are completely opposite. I am still keeping an open mind about Emily, Joe Han 's work is still perfect. Lyrics didn 't do the job for me and melody was nice but when it comes to LP my expectations just stay sky high which I feel it wasn 't able to match. Once again I like Emily 's voice. Also, the length of the song is just too short. I don 't hate the song, but I would never search for it to listen. It 's more like if spotify plays it I might listen (depends upon the mood). No emotional attachment to the song at all.;1
2024-09-24T19:56:17Z;@P51Michael_;This proves that she fits with the band. It 's when she sings the old songs that people will compare her to Chester, and that 's impossible.;0
2024-09-24T21:15:22Z;@SonGohan-gh1yl;I’m just comparing to other female singers, her cleans are great but her screaming isn’t there at all, no range or technique when she does it;0

2024-09-24T19:55:05Z;@jeremiahjohnson5431;I know she is not Chester but her on the new stuff is so much better than her on classics.  She tends to swing to low notes as each stanza endes bringing the overall feeling of the song down with it while chester swung to higher notes as each stanza ended brining a sense of hope into their music, if she is to carry on the legacy she needs to follow that pattern.;0

People gotta understand that choosing a new band member is more than just finding someone with a good singing voice. We can debate all day and night if she can do things as well as Chester, but looking at them perform live, they are having fun, they are all smiling on stage. And it seems that Emily is becoming good friends with the guys. I like her energy on stage. That 's why this works so well and why this is Linkin Park! Because it seems to me they are getting along really well off stage as well. That 's what matters most. I miss Chester, despite never having met him. I wish I saw them live when he was still alive, but I never did. I 'm just happy that my favorite band is making new music and most importantly that they seem HAPPY.;1

2024-09-24T19:40:05Z;@andreasmuller1877;Ladies an Gentlemen, Linkin Park is going to build a new Era and I Love it from the Start ❤ Chesters Voice was Unique and i love all the Stuff with him because i grew up with their Music. And One Word to all the People who does not recognize that Emily ist not in the Band to make Chester forgotten or something else: Open your Minds for this New Era with another incredible Singer! Chester is not Dead - he always lives on in our Minds and his Songs.  Linkin Park forever ❤❤❤❤;0

2024-09-24T19:40:16Z;@abderraoufbenamor1353;I dont see any better drum basline for a sound like that, maybe more bass could give it another dimension, also blending Chester 's voice here     94 1:34  dont you find that good ?;0

2024-09-24T19:33:28Z;@jamierobinson2707;This should have been the first song release. The ‘heavy is the crown’ lyric feels like a tribute and acknowledgement to the fact Emily knows Chester has left some big shoes to fill. In some ways it reminds me of how AC/DCs Brian Johnson paid homage to Bon Scott with back in black. This tune is amazing!;0

2024-09-24T19:27:50Z;@Sagramore92;The new Linkin Park-Songs are awesome!  The only thing for me personally is that those Songs could be mixed/mastered a bit more on the same level.    'Emptiness Machine ' has a great balance between Bass, Mid and treble, but the audio lacks with its own volume.   'Heavy Is The Crown ' has a great field of treble and volume, maybe a bit to loud, Drums are right on point! But it feels like it could have a bit more Mid and Bass range;0
2024-09-24T19:27:39Z;@abderraoufbenamor1353;Guys is that Chester 's voice blended with Emily 's or it 's just me imagining ?     94 1:34 ;5

2024-09-24T19:24:15Z;@shadowdancenz;another great track.  Emily can scream, but we need to see if she can sing.  Chester could show pure emotion and ... well... purity also. Even when he was singing tracks that had the raw delivery. I am not sure I am feeling the sentiment and emotion from Emily yet. Just a lot of screaming and punching you in the gut with vocals.;0

2024-09-24T19:07:59Z;@Will_Forge;This one does feel like Hybrid Theory in a nice way. Seems like Mike is doing Chester 's male vocals and his own rapping while she 's handling Chester 's screaming portions and adding some female vocals as well. I don 't know if Lincoln Park can ever be the same but this formula could work. Like, this song feels like one of the good but not best of Hybrid Theory 's soundtrack. It 's no  'In The End ', but it 's still Hybrid Theory if that makes any sense.;1

2024-09-24T19:01:23Z;@BlondeHunterAvakin;Getting a new singer to continue the band, especially a female singer is already a big risk for them. People (not all) have been complaining about how it makes it not sound like Linkin Park anymore.  Imagine them suddenly make the instrumental/vibe/genre something not  'very Linkin Park '. The critics would be even worst.  Maybe this is just one of their tactics to make us fan to slowly adapt the new era with new singer. Hopefully, just like they always do, will experiment more to their sound in the future album.;0

I must admit It 's painful for me to hear LP without Chester I guess I 'm just not over him and probably will never be. Anyway I wish them luck and success for their new album.;0

2024-09-24T18:29:32Z;@Sir_Rebral;So funny seeing people say  'She wont be able to do the 15 second scream live like Chester 's Given Up scream '   These fake fans saw a couple videos where Chester did it live and think he ALWAYS did the full 17 seconds, he didn 't. Emily has already performed this live in Hamburg and almost nailed the entire 15 seconds. Even her first performance of Given Up was a really impressive length. People hating are idiots, we 've had two songs from their album and both of them are great, stop living in the past' everyone wants Chester back but he 's not coming back, accept it and enjoy the new music.;0
2024-09-24T18:29:26Z;@lorkhan610;My theory is she did this scream 1 second short from Chester 's scream in Given Up (17 sec) to show her respect to him. So cool!;1

2024-09-24T18:28:48Z;@DenDave_;Maybe im wrong, but it kinda feels like the scream is them trying to emulate Chester, since thats one of the things he 's most known for. As if they 're saying  'see Emily can do it too '. Not sure how i feel about that.;0
2024-09-24T18:49:33Z;@VIKINGKING95;What a L take. So just because Chester was known for screams as well means Emily can 't scream? There 's lots of singers who can scream like Chester and some probably do it a bit better as well. What about all the people who do their own take on Linkin park? They aren 't allowed to scream? because this is what you just implied.;0
2024-09-24T18:28:41Z;@IvanGRJ20;No matter what others say about this, it 's gorgeous, it 's almost identical to  'Faint ' but more energetic and medieval and that 's what characterizes Linkin Park, I 'm looking forward to hearing the full album, it 'll be a blast 🔥💯🔥;0

2024-09-24T17:32:49Z;@P1NGRecordings;I think there 's a reason this video is both LP and LoL. Since Emily has to step up in the bigger shoes of Chester and since a lot of people doubt her, this has double meaning: both that the crown is heavy for Emily and also the crown ( the world championship) is heavy for any team who wants to win.  That is why it cuts back and forth between LP and LoL players.;0

2024-09-24T17:32:38Z;@Brandon_Cash;Another hit?! Love the vibes of this one. That 15sec scream is not a direct stab at the famous 17sec Given Up scream like some seem to be thinking. It is just a long scream and many screamers do it. If it were a true stab, she would alter the screaming method in the middle of it like CB did. This is just a good showcase of her scream. On another note (pun intended), I am not sure what I think about the very audible breaths throughout the song between screams. They seem a bit too prominent like they are being accentuated.;0

2024-09-24T17:23:58Z;@evilheroes93;Eh... Meu medo aconteceu, uma banda ser cover de si própria. Emilly seu vocal e ótimo, não tem como negar, mais a música... Putz, ela é muito Ctrl + C/Ctrl + V. Na sua primeira música Emptyss Machine e uma coisa nova que espero bem ser impactante, mas o progresso dessa música não parece ser tão grande como foi dito por Mike, seria algo do início do zero. Temos exemplo forte que foi o álbum do Slipknot  'End, Far ' que por sua vez foi álbum muito mal explorado e sem motivos para criar ele. Desculpe, mais de ponto zero, seria algo inovador e desafiador, essa música não me traz algo novo como um foo fighters ou Green Day. Algo inovador seria um toque do rap com rock que e essa mistura maneira que se caracteriza LP, isso e ser considerado original, fazer algo novo do nada, mais não perdendo a essência do LP.;0

2024-09-24T17:08:06Z;@RichardFASmith;I 'm blown away by the new songs with Emily so far. I can hear elements of every previous album with a layer of something new preventing it from being a stale rehash of older music.  Emptiness Machine had echoes of A Thousand Suns ' Burning in the Skies, Minutes to Midnight 's What I 've Done, Hunting Party 's Final Masquerade with shades of New Divide thrown in. Heavy is the Crown reminds me of Meteora 's Faint, Minutes to Midnight 's Bleed It Out, and Hunting Party 's Guilty all the Same.  Given how different those albums were from each other it 's impressive that they can incorporate those styles without making an incoherent mess, and on top of that they still manage to keep it sounding fresh. I 'm super hyped for the album release if these two tracks are any indication of what we can expect.;0

I looked up the track times and all of them are under/around 3 minutes. That would indicate that most of the songs are right to the point, which is good sometimes, but this track is also a bit repetitive/generic. I hope that some of the other songs are catchy, but also more diverse in their presentation.;2

2024-09-24T16:52:17Z;@Roxollox;It 's so nice to hear the song, but the LOL MV ruined everything. I 've been listening to Linkin Park songs since 2004. But LOL MV is so shocking. I think Linkin Park and LOL should have made the music video separately. Game fans are very disappointed. Because the LOL Championship is a huge annual event and all fans wait for the MV based on last year 's championship results for a year, but this time it 's become a promotional video for Linkin Park 's comeback.

2024-09-25T02:01:44Z;@freyoleitfus;Actually it would be stupid not to see that the songs being released not only musically give back a proper LP feeling, but also lyrics aren’t casual at all, and rightfully they push on the need for acceptance that for sure Emily feels.  Emptiness Machine:  “Let you cut me open  Just to watch me bleed (the haters?) Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be (fans want Chester and not her, who tries to be accepted) Don’t know why I’m hoping For what I won’t receive (!!!) Falling for the promise of the emptiness machine (I interpret it as the society btw more than the fanbase, but it’s a personal interpretation) […] I only wanted to be part of something (she arrived there with them just to play jams, and slowly she became part of the group, but she still feels having to justify herself for taking the spot)”  And indeed, on the next song she speaks of a crown, clearly the one of Chester, being heavy.  There are for sure other meanings, and indeed good songs are allegories who can feel the most related to them even when stories are very different. But I still feel there’s a lot of Emily fear of inappropriateness in all of this. However I’m happy she’s destroying every stage so far!;5
2024-09-25T03:34:10Z;@hybridcore4684;@@freyoleitfus I think, she was nervous at the beginning, especially at the comeback concert, which was her first LP concert. However, her fear has now transformed into respect and enthusiasm. In particular at the Germany concert, when you saw her weared ;4
2024-09-25T04:28:00Z;@freyoleitfus;@@hybridcore4684 yeah I’m from AMS, I wanted to go to but I couldn’t. Hopefully I’ll make it for Paris tomorrow!    They hate because either:  1. They’re pathological with having standard models to which their life has to adhere as not to fall int;0

2024-09-24T18:32:09Z;@rashira9610; 'it sounds like they trying to recapture what made the first few albums so good '  See this is the problem. People keep saying that THIS is what they want. But when they GET IT, they complain and make it seem like the band should be doing something else.  Just like with Eminem. People complain when he puts out new music that isn 't just a bunch of Slim Shady stuff. Then when he does they complain because he's relying on his old gimmick too much.  Just be happy the band is TRYING;0
2024-09-24T18:37:08Z;@texdingo0079;@rashira9610  see, I DON 'T want them to redo what they already did with a new singer. If you 're gonna move forward then move forward.  It 's not a  'new era ' if it feels like an old one. And again, keep her the hell away from the old songs;0

2024-09-24T16:36:43Z;@aaronlanders95;as a long time linkin park fan  '20 years ' i didn 't like her live performance and agreed with most of the comments. however i think this is the perfect type of song for her. no one will ever be Chester bennington, she hasn 't got as much vocal tone in her fry scream, but you can tell she sings this song with everything she 's got... heart and soul, like she means everything she 's saying, this is why i like this song, it reminds me of chester R.I.P;0

It genuinely ran shocks through my body especially the League of legends trailer.  I know her past and the bands personal relation with Chesters Mothers and Son is Sour now....... that has to get resolved.;0
2024-09-24T18:39:54Z;@rashira9610;Kinda sounds to me like you don't hate Emily but are too scared to leave the Anti-Emily echo chamber because you don't want to be called bad for  'Supporting ' her;0

2024-09-25T04:16:13Z;@Thats_Awesome;@@rashira9610 Her statement doesnt indicate anything about her being in a cult or being forced. Is she still in Scientology?  What about the mother of Chester saying that Mike would inform her about reforming the band but they never did?;0

2024-09-25T02:48:42Z;@freyoleitfus;I don’t think there’s any example in music history of a band being quiescent for many years after that the lead figure left or passed away, just to come back with a lead singer being so different yet so similar, and with the band taking up a musical legacy which was buried under the ground since at least fifteen years, interpreting it however as if time never passed.;0

2024-09-24T16:13:02Z;@MyLifeMyShou;I get a bmth vibes from this. Her growl scream sounds good but it lacks power. The mixing of the instrumentals also makes her sound muddy and not as punchy. It 's good but too short.;0
2024-09-24T16:12:59Z;@aDot89;People need to remember that Xero &gt' LP was Mike 's creation. The passing of Chester was devastating for us fans but imagine what it 's like for the band / family. Why shouldnt they be allowed to continue the band??? Music is therapy. Chester will forever live in the music but Emily is also a part of the LP family too now. ACCEPT IT!

2024-09-24T16:08:05Z;@user-ud5gz8nw7k;Is this the music video for Linkin Park 's new song? Why are there so many scenes of Linkin Park singing? Who is the main character? I know that Linkin Park 's songs are great and that they are a great band. However, I don 't think it 's right for the band to show this many faces singing.;0
2024-09-24T16:08:04Z;@rcomp1;I thought this was going to be a cover of the song by Daughtry after I saw the name.

2024-09-24T16:07:48Z;@KrwlngShadow;At first you had my curiosity. But now you have my attention, LP. As an oldschool LP fan, this is an absolute banger. It reminds me of the Meteora/HT days, but it adds a new spin to it. I can picture Chester singing this, but enough about him. Emily freaking kills it on this track. I 'm definitely interested in hearing the rest of the album.;0

It took me about half way through the live stream and by the end i liked her but i have watched a couple of the gigs and I cant imagine anyone else doing it now. Also that scream, holy hell that was impressive. Shes definately making a statement with these songs. I do have a feeling not all the album is going to be old style LP but i dont care im up for whatever they throw at us.;0

2024-09-24T16:04:28Z;@PedroHenrique-pt4zn;Arrasaram, nessas duas músicas novas notamos o empenho da Emily e sendo sincero, as músicas foram feitas pra ela. Excelente som, todos arrasaram.;1
2024-09-24T16:04:23Z;@Colt2OO2;Yeah we can definitely say that in comparison to One More Light (which I think is a great album by the way and I 'm saying that as someone who doesn 't really listen to pop that much, I 'm not trying to slate it when I say this), From Zero is already shaping up to be back along the lines of the Linkin Park everyone fell in love with back in the day and I 'm here for it. I thought Emily sounded great when they did this live the other night and she sounds great here too, the haters can say what they want about her vocals and that 's fine but I think she 's slotting in pretty nicely so far, obviously she 's not Chester nor is she trying to be even with that long scream but she 's doing her own thing and I 'm vibing with it. As far as Chester 's mom and son are concerned, I think they just need help (especially his son as he cut off contact with his dad not long before he died from what I understand and in my opinion is glamourizing this whole thing) because evidently they still haven 't quite gotten over his death yet and that 's perfectly understandable but despite being his family, they have no right to try and use his name against the rest of the band like was <b>his</b> band and his alone and assume all the songs were only his just because he sang the majority of them like I think they 're trying to do when they have no legal right or say in any sense over this reunion and anybody with common sense knows that a band is about everybody 's collective effort, no band revolves around one singular person no matter how big some personalities or iconic some voices may be. His mother even said he told her Mike belittled him, which I think is complete and utter bullshit on her part designed to further the division because not long after he joined, Chester quite literally helped Mike keep his spot in the band early on because the label wanted to either demote or simply get rid of him to focus solely on Chester and he wouldn 't let them do it plus Mike has never struck me as the type of guy that would repay that kindness in such a cruel way especially from what I 've read of personal experiences the fans have had with him, we 'd have probably known about it by now if it was true because Chester was always really open in his interviews up until the end. They can be upset about it all they want as can the haters but how about they don 't try to ruin it for the fans who are enjoying this new era of Linkin Park such as myself, we 're all allowed to have our own opinions and we won 't agree on everything but let 's separate art from the people and just be glad they 're back;1

Linkin Park is still his favorite band and I can 't wait for us to see them together in concert. We were going to get tickets for the OML concert and he never got over not seeing Chester. But he 's loving Emily!! Sorry for the novel... just feel like y 'all are the only ones who know and understand all these emotions! 😊;409

2024-09-24T15:55:51Z;@NeedBloodPoints;Emily Armstrong cannot adequately replace Chester Bennington, as her vocal delivery exhibits a completely different tonal quality. While Bennington mesmerized listeners with his unmistakable melancholy and profound emotional depth, Armstrong lacks the ability to elicit the same level of emotional resonance. Chester, with his almost elegiac and vulnerable voice, skillfully created a cathartic experience through his melodies—something entirely missing in Armstrong 's grittier and more clipped vocal approach.  Armstrong’s voice, though undeniably powerful, lacks the subtlety and the melancholic anguish that were hallmarks of Chester’s style. Furthermore, her performances lack the expansiveness and lasting impact that Chester 's vocals had, along with the absence of those memorable, sing-along choruses that leave a lasting impression. This diminishes her suitability as a replacement in such an emotionally charged musical environment.  Some may argue,  'Emily isn 't supposed to replace Chester, ' but that argument clearly doesn’t hold up. When stepping into a band so deeply defined by the emotional gravitas of Chester 's voice, any new vocalist will inevitably face direct comparisons. The void left by Chester demands someone who can preserve, or at least reflect, that same depth of feeling. Whether intended or not, the expectation exists. Armstrong’s inability to replicate or channel that core experience makes it clear that, in practice, she is expected to fill a role Chester uniquely embodied. Without doing so, she falls short, which is why this argument fails to justify her place in comparison to Chester.;1

Volver a escuchar rapear a Mike es muy nostálgico, me alegro de que la banda comenzara esta nueva etapa junto a Emily. Sé que a Chester no le hubiera gustado que la banda se estancara después de su partida, que bueno que Linkin Park siga construyendo su legado y entregándonos excelentes canciones. 💜;1

But those two songs are absolute bangers and capture everything that LP was, including the rapping, the main vocal and the overall sound.  Although Chester is irreplacable, I truly believe that other hard-core fans will give her a proper chance. And that we will have one amazing new album that marks start of a brand new LP era.

2024-09-24T18:14:35Z;@응원주작;​@@MisterKrakensTo compare it to NLB, it is at the level of giving Tom Brady amateur-level treatment. This should not have happened in League of Legends. To some, he may be just one player, but League of Legends ignores him, who is everyone 's idol. At least I would have been enthusiastic if Linkin Park 's unique characteristics had been revealed. however. That MV had no understanding of Linkin Park. If it was like this, we could have made Emily show off Faker and created a true Heavy is the crown, but we couldn 't do that. As a T1 fan and a Linkin Park fan, I am not satisfied with this collaboration. I don 't want this song to be criticized;0

2024-09-24T15:43:45Z;@AshishKulkarni7;LP is 2 for 2 so far!  'The Emptiness machine ' was an absolute banger, and it 's amazing to see Emily earning her screaming chops and really unleash it in  'Heavy is the crown ' ! This is the resurgence of Linkin Park, and I 'm all here for it.;0
2024-09-24T15:43:44Z;@skadusshh8874;I love LP, Addition of Emily to the band is amazing, the title Heavy is the Crown probably bear so much weight on the team after Chester, Also works great on the Collab with League of Legends.  However, one critic I have for this new song, the repeating tune of the opening, just seems off with the song....felt off beat even during the rest of the song.;0

2024-09-24T15:41:39Z;@BrendanGeormer;I do like the song because I really enjoy older LP 's sound and this does a great job of recreating it, but I do feel like her yell-singing is a bit raspy or a trill. Maybe that 's intentional, but I feel like it would sound better if it was a cleaner voice. Not hate, just trying to provide constructive criticism.;0

2024-09-24T15:41:04Z;@Darkddmaster;I felt like sometimes we dont get to hear Mr. Han too much, but this song really lets you feel every band member. Vocals, turntables, bass, drums, guitar, everything feels like it is coming through and so good.;92
2024-09-25T02:41:12Z;@freyoleitfus;I honestly think people are just ignorant on this matter. And I don’t say the word “ignorant” as to carry a negative connotation, but just as a matter of fact of not knowing about something. Which therefore leads to being incapable of appreciating it or even more frequently to understand it.;2
2024-09-30T01:51:22Z;@Lady_Papillon;@@freyoleitfus I agree. even as a musician myself with many years of experience (nearing a decade), I for example do not know exactly  how turntables are supposed to sound so for now I can 't recognize them' so I 'll do my research to combat my own ignora;0

But we are not looking for someone who will. We are looking for someone who will honour Chester and accompany the band on its new path and make Chester and us proud. And you do that so incredibly well. Emily, Colin and the rest of LP: We 're keen to go down this new path with you. You 're doing a fantastic job and I hope to be lucky enough to get a ticket for the next gig in Germany. Thank you! What a banger btw ... 😍;1

2024-09-24T15:32:56Z;@josefranciscojf2752;I discovered Linkin Park in a unusual way: from an online review written of the album Reroute to Remain by In Flames (of which I 'm a fan by chance), in which the person who wrote review make compared the album 's sound with Linkin Park. I thought the band 's name was so cool that I decided to try listening to see if the two bands were really similar. I was disappointed, because in my opinion they are not the same at all, but I really liked the variety of musical styles Linkin Park 's albums presented and, of course, the voice of the incredible Chester (R.I.P). So this will be the band 's first release since I became a fan of them. I liked what I heard from The Emptiness Machine, but this new one is also great. May it be Emily Armtrong 's first of many albums with the band 🤘🤘🤘;0
2024-09-24T15:32:55Z;@iLoveLinkinPark-ch32t3r;From Chester’s 17-second long scream to Emily’s 15-second long scream both very good and impressive who else agrees;4
2024-09-24T15:43:47Z;@TheMenInTightsPodcast;Emily 's scream was 14 seconds;1
2024-09-24T16:03:17Z;@iLoveLinkinPark-ch32t3r;@@TheMenInTightsPodcastI timed it just now and it’s 15.8 I was wrong before lol;1
2024-09-27T22:22:50Z;@nemesis6486;​@@TheMenInTightsPodcast 16.63s in studio version, 12s live in Hamburg debut, 15s live in O2 London. I have a feeling they purposely not let the scream get over 17s to show respect for the late Chester, and I understand why. Still, she 's more than capable, it 's amazing.;0

Агрессивная, или точнее, драйвовая подача Эмили - просто отвал жопы. И совсем не похожа на TEM. И парт Эмили в короне просто восхитительный, её рычащее исполнение такое ВАУ, и её скримы - я просто стою на коленях, королева, КОРОЛЕВА🛐🛐🛐 Если другие песни в альбоме будут на том же уровне, что и эти две, то я готова хоть ещё семь лет ждать новые треки;0

2024-09-24T15:27:58Z;@MezThelegend;Decent song. But I can 't get behind Emily. Lost was the perfect way to close the book on the band.   If she left scientology good for her. But scientology is a cult. They have done terrible things, and will continue to do so. I wish Emily and them luck. But the band is over for me.  I got in to the band because I felt Chester 's emotions and pain. It was a bond I formed with my dad. He 's gone. Chester 's gone. The current band doesn 't have the same energy or sound. I 'll continue to listen to classic LP and Mike 's solo stuff. But I think I 'll be getting off at the next stop. The ride was fun, and I hope it runs smoothly going forward for everyone.;1
2024-09-24T15:30:42Z;@mathdrop96;yeah, I honestly think it 's disrespectful to keep performing under the name linkin park without chester. linkin park is over.;1

Chester era su vocal inconfundible y me alegro de que no quieran reemplazarlo de una manera burda,  que optaran por una vocal femenina para evitar comparaciones tontas es un acierto (algunos idiotas lo hacen lol) lo cierto es que la nueva cantante tiene el crugido de los gritos de chester pero sin tener una voz que se le parezca.

2024-09-24T15:20:55Z;@serenity9260;here 's my theory about LP. almost all their 3rd singles will be the best song for the albums in the end numb waiting for the end Castle of Glass Final Masqurade  We already have 2 bangers and the best is yet to come!;1

2024-09-24T15:20:47Z;@ketanchoudhary684;As a long time Linkin park fan I would say some people are hyping this too much.. I mean its just an ok-ish song. I would even go as far as saying its below LP standards. Cuz it sounds generic for some reason. usually LP songs has equally good instrumentals besides their vocals. Which I feel is lacking here. Emptiness machine is better than this.;1

2024-09-24T15:16:50Z;@RagingEntertainment;I 'm not trying to be a negative jerk, but I 'm not happy with the decision you guys made with the new singer. You can tell that she 's trying to sound like Chester when she 's not him. She 'll never be Chester. This so-called album should be a one and done. I 'm sure Chester would want you guys to move on, but I believe he would find this disrespectful to his legacy. Just let Linkin Park be done and have Mike do his solo project.;2
2024-09-24T15:25:52Z;@GotoMaki4Micah;i wanted more of mike solo as well. there needs to be male energy if chester was ever to be replaced. replacing him with a female is just what media has been doing to strong men for years. just putting on a band aid of what ever is pop culture and pc at the  moment.;1
2024-09-24T15:16:50Z;@nemesis6486;16sec scream to be exact, i guess it 'ssomehow a way to show respect to the late Chester by not exceding 17sec. You proved your worth Emily. Welcome to Linkin Park!!  This is what you ask FOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRR!!;5

2024-09-24T15:11:26Z;@josephaversa2494;That scream was about 15 seconds long, Emily 's amazing! Also the  'It keeps bleeding out, ' lyric referencing  'Bleed It Out ' is not lost on me. This song has a mix of Meteora and Minutes To Midnight vibes, and I can 't get enough of it. You guys are awesome, keep up the immaculate music.;147
2024-09-24T15:13:17Z;@mxdnxghtraven;Yes this! Meteora and MTM are my favorite albums (so far), From Zero is turning out to be a fun blend of the two;4

2024-09-24T15:11:25Z;@traydaniel0403;I really hope Paramount Pictures, Skydance &amp' Hasbro bring back Anthony Ramos, Dominique Fishback, Luna Lauren Velez, Dean Scott Vazquez, Tobe Nwigwe, Hailee Steinfield, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., Jason Drucker, and John Cena in this crossover and probably break down the film to part 1 &amp' 2: give part 1 a 2hrs 40mins run-time and give part 2 a 3hrs run-time.  I also hope Ron Perlman and Pete Davidson also return to voice Optimus Primal and Mirage.  And if they decide to help find Bumblebee’s voice, hope Dylan O’ Brien returns to voice Bee from Bumblebee (2018)    Also, will Linkin Park returns to write new original songs with their new lead singer frontwoman Emily Armstrong? I really hope they do soon if they want to 🤘🏽, because without them, there would be no Transformers film.  I know it’ll probably be taking place in the ‘90s, but can LP make it sound like the 90s vibes though?;0

2024-09-24T16:19:20Z;@horror-core;​@@mr.cookey For sure. She 's had vocal training in the past. Some people think she 's straining her voice but that 's just what her style sounds like. She uses her diaphragm, and this is what you get when she really let 's go. I love it!;1

2024-09-24T15:06:48Z;@stevenstone307;To be honest this was incredibly formulaic and bland for me. It sounds like a demo for one of their early albums, a song that wouldn 't make the final cut of the early Linkin Park standard. A very generic song to me, the long scream was impressive but felt out of place in this song, nothing was building up to it. The instruments are very muted and simple, meh meh meh. Emptiness Machine was 10x better than this.;0

2024-09-24T15:27:30Z;@BI20DI3M4N;@@TheAlpineAddict It is just a thought. Just a way of saying it is hard to let go of the past more so. Plus, the controversy with LP bringing Emily on board. I 'm all for her, but many aren 't apparently. Even though I support her and the new changes, it ;0
