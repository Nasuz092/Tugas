2024-10-03T19:38:18Z;@jaredhall5169;Since Dadadan is technically a romantic-comedy... one of my favourite things about it is that Momo and Okarun are both given equal weight as protagonists. They both get plenty of screen-time both together and apart, they both have powerful fighting abilities, they both save each other many times and they both get character development.

2024-10-03T18:18:43Z;@SakugaObscurious;The staff list for this show is insane- The director is Fuga Yamashiro a veteran of Science SARU this is his directorial debut, The character designer is Naoyuki Onda. He did character designs for Ergo Proxy  Rage of Bahamut and Gantz, The alien and creature designs are by the legendary Yoshimichi Kameda. Hes done way too much  but among his notable works includes - FMAB  Mob Psycho and One Punch Man. But heres the best part the majority of EP1 was key animated by young new animators  rather then veterans like Kameda. The sheer directorial and storyboard work of the episode director  Abel Gongora (another major member of Science SARU  worked on Scott Pilgrim, Devilman, etc.)  made it look this good.;2010

2024-10-03T18:09:01Z;@Kudian;First episodes usually take a little getting used to for me. Like, theyre good, but never really fully on board until maybe the second or third episode. But this first episode for ダンダダン actually lived up to the hype, for me. It was amazing to get to see such a favorite series of mine animated. And based off everything Ive seen, the studio really let loose with it. The animators clearly got to have creative freedom and do what they felt was necessary. And getting Creepy Nuts to do the intro for the series is just the cherry on top of it all, man;29

2024-10-03T17:21:21Z;@brub1738;They did it they genuinely made the perfect opening for DANDADAN They somehow managed to both capture the surreal and weird elements and the more heartfelt and emotional elements into one theme song holy peak fiction;2086
2024-10-03T23:17:13Z;@ThePretzelBread;I remember when this first leaked everyone talking about how it didnt fit, but I just thought those people forgot Dandadan is actually a love story.;47
2024-10-04T02:00:48Z;@whimsidroyd;@@ThePretzelBreadseriously? this i think perfectly captures both the horror and action aspect as well as the romance and fluff;17
2024-10-04T02:42:57Z;@brub1738;@@ThePretzelBreadyeah it’s shame that so many people wrote it off because they don’t understand that DanDaDan is a blending of shonen action with romance instead of one or the other;25

I prefer the more melodic &amp musical approach. Their songs seem to be all about catchy percussive &amp repeatable phrases, rather than the melodies &amp intricate songwriting. Although they are incredible musicians &amp players and I have massive respect for them in general. I just wish I could like their music more. The OP visuals though are absolutely mind-blowing!;12
