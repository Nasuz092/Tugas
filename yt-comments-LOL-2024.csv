2024-01-16T09:12:54Z,@shizueigaki702,I cannot even emphasize how powerful the lyrics are. And Tiffany and your vocals just bring out the emotions flowing out. So many different layers. Especially right at the end when Tryndamere sees Ashe. I realize now that the last I&#39;m still here is Ashe telling Trynd that she is still there for him.,13

2024-01-16T12:30:24Z,@Meow-ds7pr,"The phrase &quot;got my heel crushing the snake&quot; is a metaphorical expression. It&#39;s often used to symbolize overcoming or defeating evil, temptation, or adversarial challenges. This imagery is deeply rooted in various cultural and religious traditions.<br><br>One of the most well-known origins of this metaphor comes from the Christian Biblical story of Adam and Eve in the Book of Genesis. After the serpent (often interpreted as Satan or a representation of evil) tempts Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, God curses the serpent, saying, &quot;He will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.&quot; This is commonly interpreted as a prophecy about the coming of Christ and the defeat of evil.<br><br>In a more general sense, the image of crushing a snake under one&#39;s heel has come to represent the act of conquering or subduing something harmful or malevolent. It implies a struggle or conflict where the person (symbolized by the heel) ultimately triumphs over a negative force (symbolized by the snake).<br><br>When someone says they &quot;got my heel crushing the snake,&quot; they&#39;re likely expressing their determination to overcome a challenge or obstacle they perceive as negative, harmful, or evil. It&#39;s a statement of strength, resilience, and victory against adversity.",1

I think it was real in the terms that Kindred was both there and not there. He was actually fighting the wolf, those soldiers and attacking lamb all at the same time.

Many of us still remember that one time we wake up &amp; suddenly have to search for the will to live, to keep on existing. The recurring fear of one day becoming old &amp; indifferent, leaving our dreams forsaken. I&#39;m made to sympathize with these characters in ways I didn&#39;t think was possible.<br>&quot;Still here&quot; is a powerful message, with the song and the animation synchronized masterfully.

The undying Barbarian King vs death itself is a strange versus but it makes complete sense because Tryndamere is completely different from someone like Olaf whose destined to not die in battle because Tryndamere just doesnt have any real explanation for why he’s surviving so many devastating wounds like when Garen stabs him in his chest. <br><br><br>I rly hope they do more Kindred scenes in the future. There are some beings I believe might be immune to death like the ascended, the forsaken isle ppl, and Mordekaiser and im rly curious to see if Kindred even bothers to try and hunt those whove lived well beyond their years",3

2024-01-14T12:48:11Z,@Vexy93,"I love how Kindred was shown as a true entity, but then was revealed as what she is. Not death hunting you down, but the concept of imminent death.<br>Tryndamere wasn&#39;t fighting the Wolf and the Lamb. He was fighting the enemies attacking him, with each of their strikes being deadly. He wasn&#39;t blocking the wolf, he was blocking their attacks.<br>The Lamb was there because despite all his efforts, he would still have died from the 2 guys from behind. But the moment Ashe came into  his help, the Lamb disappeared, because Tryndamere wasn&#39;t anymore risking to die.<br><br>I would love Kindred to be reworked into this concept. Instead of being a hunter collecting lifes, she should be the concept of imminent death. She should have an Evelynn&#39;s like passive that gives her cammuflage and increased movement speed when moving towards targets on low health",3

2024-01-15T00:11:57Z,@spiderbinky6183,"@@marian1000brb Morgana’s lore says otherwise. Yes it’s called dark bc Demacia sees all magic as evil. Morganas voice line “they call me “evil” shall I prove them right?” Means they only see her that way and she has the choice to but she doesn’t. She helps people in the lands outside of Demacia, she’s known as the Veiled Lady. If anything Kayle is “evil” she is blind justice, Morgana gives people a chance to redeem themselves.",0
2024-01-15T01:04:05Z,@marian1000brb,"@@spiderbinky6183 she has dark flames. Never implying about her by being evil...dark magic and black magic are different. Her powers represent the pain and sorrow that she and all the outcasts feel. Morgana represents the redemption through pain. If you recognize your sins her chains will cleanse your soul from your burden without a great harm(a little pain). Morgana is more connected with the world being able to see and hear Sylas&#39;s cry from his prison. She can also represents the dark side of justice where a murderer can be pardoned from all his guilt, if he recognize it and feels sorry. That&#39;s why her magic is darker for she is connected with the world while Kayle&#39;s magic is shiny like the sun for she never cared about the humanity and never walked among them.",0

And when Ashe&#39;s arrows come streaking through the fog slaying the two barbarians at his back removing the thing that was fated to kill him, Kindred fades away because it&#39;s no longer his time to die. Plus the sequence itself was a pure masterpiece, Wolf&#39;s ferocity was absolutely incredible to watch and Lamb was beautiful in her grace. And you can tell Lamb was fascinated by this mortal who refused to die, not fleeing or accepting his death but defying it. Just <b>chef&#39;s kiss</b> incredible.

One of her cellmates was once a nurse at an armed police hospital. The nurse said that forced organ harvesting from living Falun Gong practitioners was an open secret when she worked there.<br><br>Ms. Li Ruihua, a native of Inner Mongolia in her 30s, worked in Beijing before her arrest. Her husband, Mr. Wu Rui, also in his 30s, is a native of Yichun City, Jiangxi Province. He worked as a training education teacher in Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province before he was arrested at the same time as his wife.<br><br>Ms. Li went to Shenzhen to visit her husband in May 2019. Agents from the Luohu District Police Station broke into their home on May 28 and seized them. <br><br>Ms. Li recently revealed that she was taken to a hospital for a comprehensive physical examination after her arrest. She was then admitted to the Luohu District Detention Center. A few days later, she was forced to give four big tubes of blood without being told why.<br><br>She asked other detainees if they had also been subjected to such a large amount of blood draw and comprehensive physical examination. They all said no. <br><br>Ms. Li was later assigned to another cell, where a cellmate immediately realized the reason behind her suspicious blood draw. This cellmate, a former armed police hospital nurse, said it was probably to see if Ms. Li was healthy enough to be the next victim of the communist regime’s forced organ harvesting from living Falun Gong practitioners. The nurse cellmate also noted that forced organ harvesting was an open secret in the hospital.<br><br>Ms. Li and her husband were indicted by prosecutor Liu Xiaona of the Yantian District Procuratorate on November 29, 2019. The Yantian District Court sentenced both of them to two years with a 3,000-yuan fine on April 1, 2021. Their appeals were soon rejected and they were ordered to serve time at the Yantian District Detention Center. <br><br>The couple were released on May 29, 2021.<br><br>The horrendous crime of the state-sanctioned forced organ harvesting was first revealed in March 2006, when a woman claimed that as many as 4,000 Falun Gong had been killed for their organs at the hospital in which she had worked. She also said that her husband, a surgeon at the same hospital outside the northeastern city of Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, had disclosed to her that he had removed cornea from the living bodies of 2,000 Falun Gong practitioners. <br><br>Since then, mounting evidence from witnesses and Chinese physicians has revealed that thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been killed for their organs, which are sold and transplanted at enormous profit in the transplant trade.<br><br>For more information about forced organ harvesting, please click here.",1

2024-01-14T08:12:38Z,@DJAizakku,"​@@2centschange To be fair, the standards were entirely different 15 years ago. She was one of the first 40 champs, a completely different era where art design wasn&#39;t taken so seriously. Have you seen old Fiddlesticks? Even though they gave her a VGU about 9 years ago, her model is still working with those extremely outdated underpinnings, and you probably can&#39;t do much else without breaking the model or making the animations look more jank than what they already are. She desperately needs an ASU like what Ahri got, but apparently those take forever to make.",0

The reason it is good, is because it shows the overcoming of a great challenge, where perseverance through not only duty but because of who you are - fighting for what you believe in. It is relatable on a human level. This weirdly enough ties in to sportsmanship within the game, not giving up as an ideal scenario. Furthermore also the specific characters and their lore. Reason I went this level deep is because I love it when Riot produces these pieces. Relatable and purposeful. Not pushing a socio political agenda, just raw emotion and humanity.",4

It doesn&#39;t really have a real consciousness, it&#39;s not even aware of its existence. It just... attacks, terrifies and kills. That is all it does, as it is a being born from a primal and ever-present emotion - Fear. So I guess you could say that Fiddlesticks IS Fear, thus Fear would be its real name. Though that does not really make sense, as the Primal Demon of Joy does have a name, Ashlesh.",31

2024-01-13T04:41:51Z,@alex33785,"Got a theory on how kindred works…when trynd was fighting her…if it would have went on with no interruption trynd would of died<br><br>Maybe yes the lamb and wolf are beings but I think they are beings that lives within an idea…meaning that he’s they can just appear to anyone but imagine all those dying in the world in the same moment, they surely would also see kindred no?!! So basically the lamb and the wolf are just allowed to do anything in their realm of death<br><br>Or<br><br>When kindred appears to you, its for you real but you are let’s say stuck in 2 realms, you lose the ability to see the living realm but are still present in it physically and doing whatever actions you are doing which is what is leading you to your death…maybe the death realm works in a way that despite you fighting or seeing kindred there, the fact your death is imminent in that moment, it sends your mind to a separate timeline where kindred’s there just for you, while in the living realm, kindred isn’t there at all…the death realm of kindred might work like pockets of timelines for your mind to get trapped in while you go towards your death, that might be how kindred works in a way where the lamb and wolf can get to everyone on the verge of death<br><br>So basically when kindred appears for you, it’s a certain death unless something in the living realm changes the outcome you are in, in this case it was Ashe killing the 2 guys in the back of trynd…since also his undying rage would’ve killed him I believe and Ashe calmed him down thus saving his life",0

2024-01-13T01:14:27Z,@jbxdmoficial,"I have a theory: The tryndamere is not really fighting against the kindreds... At the beginning of the video it shows him surrounded by several enemy soldiers and at the end of the video when Ashe kills the last two soldiers from that group that was surrounding the trynda while he was on the ground, when ashe kills the last two soldiers, it shows her looking at him and him looking at her more calmly and after that he shows several soldiers on the ground lying down, implying that trynda killed all the soldiers in a fight, more like he killed the soldiers if he was fighting the kindreds? Well, he wasn&#39;t fighting the kindreds, he was actually fighting the soldiers who were representing the kindreds. His fight against the kindreds was all a representation of the fight against all the soldiers and at the moment when Ashe kills the last two soldiers, the kindred that was being represented by all of them (soldiers) in the form of death, because the soldiers wanted to kill trynda, so kindred had to leave, as ashe ended the death threat by killing the last two soldiers. It was a great fight but it didn&#39;t really happen, he was fighting against every soldier, more for him the trynda, it seemed like it was against the kindreds only he could see the kindreds, but in reality it was the soldiers.",0

Demons are something else entirely in this setting.<br><br>Keeping with the theme<br>of Death running through this cinematic, Aatrox wants nothing more than to die. But he can’t. He is bound to his sword, and neither can be destroyed by anything but a great deity. <br><br>Kayle and Morgana are two halves of an Aspect, effectively a celestial demigod based on a concept that inhabits a mortal vessel. In this case the Aspect of Justice split in half.<br>But they cannot destroy Aatrox, only his vessel/body.<br><br>The twins have long since split over a terrible mistake that killed their father and brought a city to ruin, Kayle, the light half chasing divinity and absolute justice, Morgana the dark half rejecting it, instead holding onto her humanity and advocating punishment and redemption as Justice.",14

I understand your concern about spyware, but I can assure you that Riot Vanguard is not spyware. It is a custom game security software designed by Riot Games to uphold the highest levels of competitive integrity for their games, such as League of Legends and Valorant1. Riot Vanguard only runs when you’re playing the game and stops running when you exit the game2. It also respects your privacy and data, and you can find more details about what data it uses and collects here1.<br><br>Riot Vanguard is necessary to prevent cheating and hacking in League of Legends, especially after the security breach in early 20233. It also ensures that all players have a fair and enjoyable gaming experience. If you want to play League of Legends again, you will need to enable Riot Vanguard on your computer. You can find more information on how to do that here3. If you have any issues or questions, you can contact Riot Games’ support team here1.<br><br>I hope this helps you understand why Riot Vanguard is required for League of Legends.

2024-01-13T01:32:04Z,@ultraknight40000,this animation did more for Tryndamere then every Retcon and lore change combined. Being married to one of the most important character in the Freljord should have given him something but it didn&#39;t all he had was his connection to Aatrox witch got retconned twice. Now this these connections are starting to mean something.,257

They are knocked down and struggling but they are always getting back up. “I’m still here” gives the sense of I’m still here fighting, I’m not giving in. But there is also a sense of loneliness and desperation especially in Tryndamere scene where we see him fighting and struggling alone. But then Ashe enters and then there such a sense of relief and comfort that it changes to “I’m still here with you. I’m still here by your side. You’re not alone.” I just love the hope she carries into the animation. It’s so well done!!",80

You then see him adopt this more moderate look to his face, almost somewhat tender,  then you look back to before Ashe&#39;s arrows hit and you see the look of shock on his face, and that transition begins to happen before the eyes return to their normal color.

As per lore (read the story 3 years ago, hopefully it didn&#39;t change), wolf is the &quot;coward&#39;s death&quot;, killing those who run from battle (I guess those who died while running away), while sheep is the death of those who fight till the end. So in a way, it would be nice to see them &quot;not&quot; fight together. <br><br>This fight, in this sense, was an in-game one; everyone fights. Also, while liking Ashe&#39;s save, it would have been nice if after she came, she would have found Trynda dead. Meaning he ulted, so the fight with kindred was those 5 seconds of invincibility his ult gives him, after which he dies. Imagine this: every time he uses his ultimate, he actually fights kindred. Amazing.",6

Before the clash with Kindred begins his shoulder pad is not damaged. After his rage subsided you can see the marks left on the armor by Wolf and his ferocious attacks. Tryn is surrounded by human corpses that could not leave such a mark.<br><br>So his fight with death was not a representation it was indeed real. Gave me the chills.,2

Great implementation of his abilities though.<br>6.5/10<br><br>Last clip: A true piece of art.

You can check this out LoL official info. Secondly, depicted wolf was Freljord&#39;s counterparts. Actually, Tryn was fighting with freljord&#39;s counter parts on the snowfield. During combat, Kindred came up because Tryn was almost dead. However, he overcame his death for ulti. Lastly, Kindred loosen her bow string and faded away, because Ashe ganked and save her husband with double kill. You know why 2024 lol movie named(Ashe is) still here",0

Or that i takes one hit from lamb or wolf to die and trynda thanks to his took or parried 9 hits also the lamb&#39;s head tilt like &quot;bro why are you not dead.

In that light, it seems like his resilience is almost interesting in some way to Lamb too. Imagine being strong enough to peak the interest of Death. So cool… Wolf attacking with no restraint and Lamb weaving her pinpointed shots in between… such perfect character design.",2

Si la operación se realizaba en una semana, le costaría 20 millones de yenes yendo al extranjero. Si podía esperar seis meses, sólo costaría 6 millones de yenes y podría hacerse en Japón. Para entonces, su esposo no quería utilizar el órgano de otra persona para prolongar su vida y no se operó. &quot;En aquel momento, no pensé en absoluto en el donante de órganos. Aunque lo lamento por mi esposo, al ver estas obras hoy, me alegro mucho de que no se sometiera a una operación de trasplante en aquel momento&quot;, afirma.<br><br><br><br>La Sra. Den Kazumi.<br><br>La Sra. Den Kazumi dijo conmocionada que había oído hablar de la sustracción de órganos en vivo, pero que no sabía por qué ni cómo ocurría. Ahora había atado cabos y dijo: &quot;Sé que muchos practicantes de Falun Gong han sido detenidos, pero ¿hay algunos que fueron detenidos para la sustracción de órganos?&quot;.<br><br>Dijo que el cartel La cosecha - Sangre y codicia mostraba que para algunas personas el dinero pesa más que un corazón y un hígado.<br><br>&quot;Un órgano puede ser necesario para una persona que lucha por vivir, pero si sabe lo que ha pasado, ¿habría ánimo para un trasplante?&quot;, preguntó.<br><br><br><br>Estudiante universitario Yamaoka (derecha).<br><br>Antes de ver la exposición de carteles, el estudiante universitario Yamaoka no estaba seguro de poder decir que no si uno de sus familiares u otra persona cercana pudiera beneficiarse de un trasplante de órganos. &quot;No tenía confianza para decir que no&quot;, afirma. &quot;Sin embargo, ahora que me he enterado de las víctimas que hay detrás del trasplante de órganos para salvar vidas [que el PCCh sustrae órganos de practicantes vivos de Falun Gong], tengo la confianza para decir ¡absolutamente no!&quot;.",0

But besides like two scenes I can remember of close-up shots of Pantheon and Sejuani&#39;s faces this one had really good lore and clearly had far better animation which is kinda crazy since its only been two years.,3
2024-01-12T05:05:33Z,@k09viner89,Actually I dont think thats just a &quot;vision&quot; of death becasue (and this is just my quess based on what we get) before the fight starts his shoulderpad(?) is undamaged but after the last attack the wolf gets on him leaves a bite mark on the shoulderpad which is still there after kindred goes away. TLDR; I think the fight with death was very litteral as well and not just a vision.,4
2024-01-12T07:00:48Z,@BCY88,"​@@Darksabre oh strong disagree, the themes of death and time are (in my opinion) far more interesting, it gives far more depth to champions than just lux ulting the sky (very game accurate lux tho let&#39;s be honest)",2

From league of legends, to the cinematics, to Arcane. It’s all so beautifully crafted. Balancing issues in the actual game aside, you can tell Riot genuinely cares about this world they’ve created. It makes me feel like my time spent and money spent on the game are appreciated when you get handed such wonderful things like this and Arcane gifted to the fan base. For that, I will always support Riot and I hope Riot never dies. No other gaming company exhibits the same amount of passion for its games more than Riot does.",0

2024-01-12T17:12:33Z,@antonzhdanov9653,"@@_zantetsuken_Nah, people misconcept Nasus a lot. Nasus is death machine midgame between lvl9 with max Q and lvl13 while everybody get armor from their lvl and bonking stops hurting af. Even 10000 stacks can ruin a tower in one Q but won&#39;t kill any champ of max lvl even full heal/ap Yumi bcs she has enough armor to cut this on paper huge numbers to the ground. Black cleaver /serylda/DR could fix this issue, but the problem, that this way Nasus stops being tanky while still having average damage output and easily can be kyted. And the power of Nasus that by good farming and strong tank items like GP which is also gone btw,  Nasus can temporarily achieve that OP disbalance when damage done to him is not enough to cut through his armor and heal, making him simply unkillable  unless CCed into oblivion.  I get it about this AP shield but it addresses occasional but not critical issue of disgustingly fed usually going AP mobile champs as Katarina or Ekko who is countered by CC either. From my experience of relatively low elo, very occasional issue from people smurfing several elos. Usually this kind of &quot;what if challenger go to gold&quot; kind of content.<br>I can&#39;t say that Nasus became not viable, bcs well, viability of Nasus in  each game depends totally on player bcs stacks are everything. Its champ mechanics. But Nasus became weaker a lot. I guess that&#39;s time to switch to Mundo and/or crocodile bro. Good Renekton is disgusting kind of champ.",0

So I was expecting a trynda going WILD, with blood on his eyes, an evil face showing teeth and snorting like a bull, you know? In fact, that&#39;s what &quot;fury mode&quot; is, he&#39;s completely human and keeps fighting almost mortally wounded because of anger and adrenaline at field, that&#39;s all, he&#39;s 100% human and it just crossed my mind that humans can&#39;t simply change their eye colors.

2024-01-11T16:00:37Z,@tarasdiary,tryndamere was fighting kindred who was representing death. tryndamere&#39;s time was cutting close to death as he was shown surrounded by soldiers while weak at the start of the video. so the fight between him and kindred was tryndamere fighting away the soldiers till then ashe (his wife) saved him and shot the soldiers who were about to end his life behind him so kindred disappeared meaning death was no longer there for him,2
2024-01-11T16:20:08Z,@toji6476,"tryndamere&#39;s ultimate ability makes him unkillable for 5 seconds. He&#39;s surrounded by soldiers and is in mortal danger. The creature hes fighting is death itself, symbolising tryndameres resistance towards death. So when his wife Ashe comes to save him from the soldiers surrounding him, he is no longer in mortal danger and so the kindred backs away.",1

Representing the god of death, when she comes, it means the end of life. But Trynda&#39;s resistance to death surprised her, she was like, &quot;um? this man seems different&quot;, the action of tilting her head to the side, showed her curiosity of this man without saying anything. Then when she about to end Trynda (represented by two enemy attacks from the back), she lowered down her arch by sensing Ash&#39;s arrows flying by. This action and her later fade-away, with Ash&#39;s appearence, was like a response to Kindred&#39;s curiosity before,  &quot;Death may come, but not today&quot;.  <br><br>Beautiful. this is art.",0

2024-01-11T11:30:06Z,@SirVeresta,"In this cinematic there is a few things I realized on Kindred&#39;s part. Tryndamere first sees Kindred, the death itself and they come together. I think that was enough to point out it wouldn&#39;t be that easy for Kindred because Wolf hunts the ones who want to run away whereas Lamb hunts the ones who accept their death. This man not only denied his death, he fought it. That&#39;s why they attack together. Also he could damage Kindred after his eyes turned red showing he was not going to lose. Another thing related to that is as Kindred first shot an arrow Tryndamere sliced it but after his eyes were red he punched.<br><br>All the things considered that was my favorite part in the cinematic.",0

He ripped off Tryndameres arm and killed him. He was allready strong before he got corruped by the Darkin powers wich is like the strongest force.

While in the kindred domain, enemies appear as wolf and allies as lamb. Attacking wolves functions normally to attacking enemy champions, while attacking lambs breaks your rage and ends the ult early. Slaying a wolf ends the ult and turns any grey health remaining into regular health. After use, the ability is locked - only recalling or death allows for it to proc again. That cinematic was sweet, and this feels like a cool way to turn it into something.",1

2024-01-11T07:39:43Z,@TheIconianCat,"I’m not quite sure how to put into words the fight with kindred. Particularly when trynd slashes through lamb’s bow. Obviously trynd cannot kill lamb because kindred is a primordial entity, arguably the strongest of any of them (the others being things like fiddlesticks the entity of fear) she is literally a god. But the moment she “dodges” is unnatural. It’s almost as though the world bent for a moment to ensure trynd’s blade wouldn’t touch lamb. His sword slows down, lamb moves in a fraction of a second with no real effort and then simply tilts her head.<br><br>It’s also an incredible visual to see what a struggle on the verge of death is like. Wolf’s relentless assault and lamb’s arrows combined very quickly remind you that from a lore perspective kindred is the absolute last thing you want to tango with",0

2024-01-11T07:37:07Z,@GeeGe.,"The last third of the video is my favorite. I never cared for Tryndamere in game but his ult does have a lot of cinematic potential as we see here. The way he defies death and its bringers (Kindred) creates a dynamic between those characters that is super enticing, and Ashe coming in as his savior and giving him the support he needs also makes me want to see more of those two. I&#39;m very much looking forward to watching Arcane Season 2 and every other part of the world Riot decides to work on cinematically. Arcane feels somewhat grounded and &quot;sane&quot;, which worked beautifully, but there&#39;s so much Fantasy potential for the rest of Runeterra - as we see in this video - and I can&#39;t wait to see it realized.",909

2024-01-11T08:36:55Z,@renebock1780,"@@davidcrossroad8181 In the beginning you see the Guy (Tryndamere) on the ground surrounded by enemies. The Spirit with the wolf together symbolize the Death. In reality he is fighting the Enemies who surrounded him and so at the same time he is fighting Death to not die. In the game Tryndamere has an ability who makes him somewhat invincible for some seconds (Hp does not drop below 1) and this is shown with his red eyes. In the end the woman (Ashe, his Wife) who rescues him kills the last two enemies and so he does not die and the Death fades away.",40

If u, guys need more time to perfect the game, you know what? I give u the time, but i can bet the new RIOT (mmo) game will be amazing. This is the way, where LoL need to go, yes we are humans, we rage, we say silly things, but in addition we love, we love playing, and we love playing great games! And such a game as this with such a trailer... thank you  riot, and thank you all of the players, for keeping alive the hope for tomorrow! I&#39;m speechless!

Tryn was overwhelmed by the enemies number in battle, his breath and soul was leaving his body, giving up to the  mass injuries he sustained. This is when Tryn knew his time had come, the enemies  got the better of him today, even Death itself, Kindred, had came to visit the warlord. Yet the madman simply refused to accept his fate, he simply did not feel  like dying, not today.  Tryn rose above the continuous attacks from Kindred, defying death itself,  screamed in his notorious Undying Rage, only to realize he was fighting a mental war all along, the moment Sheep put down its bow, Death has relinquished its intention, Tryndamere may live another day and Ashes&#39; arrow came to the rescue. Tryn was put back to the reality, with only a few enemies left after his death rage.",154

And people need to get right with the Lord!<br>If you have not read the books of (Daniel chapters 7-12), (Ezekiel chapters 37-39) (Matthew chapters 24:1-51 + 25:1-30), (1 Thessalonians chapters 1-5), (2 Thessalonians chapters1-3) and (Revelation chapters 6-19), now would be a good time.

These books will also be the most ominous and scary for the unbelievers and the most exciting and uplifting for those who believe in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior!<br><br>It is my hope and prayer that people would repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ before all these things take place, because it is going to be very, very scary if you do not and you decide to wait and see what happens!",1

I know for a lot of people a fun and unique part of the yearly cinematics more than any other time of the year is when you get to see the fantasy of a Champion&#39;s story and powers actually fleshed out and not as gameplay so it is always a great treat to see more and more unique champions get that treatment even just for a little bit. I&#39;m sure plenty of people eagerly await to see their favourites and Kindred enjoyers finally got some of that today.,0

It is old yas and not his master... yall over cooked😅.<br>3. Yes ashe isn&#39;t a ain&#39;t E-girl model.<br>4. The Aatrox fight is ancient demacia before morg and kayle saw things dif (had their big argument)<br>Lastly it&#39;s all dif time periods(so don&#39;t think all is happening at once)  and have yourself a successful climb this season &lt;Emerald before unmuting all&gt;",0

2024-01-11T01:28:53Z,@user-fn3pw7xv3v,"Tryndamere did not fight against Kindred. The Kindred in front of Tryndamere is a representation of death approaching Tryndamere, taking the form of a lamb and a wolf. If Tryndamere had fought Kindred, where would the enemies who were targeting Tryndamere have gone? If Tryndamere had defeated them, where would their bodies be? Where did the last appearing enemy come from? Why did Ashe shoot an arrow at the enemy lurking behind Tryndamere, not at Kindred?<br><br>Everything makes sense if we consider the enemies that initially appeared as Kindred. As Tryndamere is surrounded by enemies and death approaches, Kindred, the embodiment of death itself, appears. The lamb and wolf attack Tryndamere to harvest his death, but in reality, this is the attack of the initial enemies. Tryndamere fights against death to not succumb, but couldn&#39;t overcome it. The lamb aims its bow to harvest Tryndamere&#39;s death. However, suddenly the lamb lowers its bow. Simultaneously, the silhouette of a woman appears behind the lamb, and she shoots an arrow at the enemies behind Tryndamere. A wonderful symmetry is created with Kindred aiming the bow at Tryndamere to harvest death and Ashe aiming to save him from death.",1

2024-01-11T01:20:26Z,@domenfila575,"I really like the cinematic, all of the highly detailed animations are nice to watch. All of this comes from a place of passion not hate, but I feel like the it fell short in some areas like: <br><br>Overall intensity of the whole video was lacking, this song screams defiance but it leaves you wanting more. I know they can evoke that feeling of &quot;not giving up no matter what it costs&quot; I saw it in The Call with Sejuani and Panth.<br><br>Old Yassuos fight with the bandits, his blade looks like it has no power behind it and people just ragdoll out of the way. I have seen them do better in Awaken when Riven fought in the Noxian arena.<br><br><br>Then when Morgana brings out her true power it does go very well with the music, but her animation of summoning the chains is not as intense as I would like. She only uses one hand to stop Aatrox who is a behemoth and her eyes dont go full purple and you can barely hear her scream over the music as she is maintaining the chains. I feel like a half a second more on Morg as she is casting the chains and bring that scream into the foreground would be better.<br><br>Then Kayle, when she ascends, they could have done it a shot in sync with the last three drum beats and have her swords light up <b>bum*, close up on her intense face and glowing eyes *bum</b> and her attack <b>bum</b> and let the scene breathe for a sec.<br><br>And lastly the Trynd and Kindred scene which was very good and a fantastic portray of both the char. on screen. But It would give more stakes if Trynd showed some signs of injury while combating The Wolf (he does have a claw mark on his one piece of armor on his shoulder), maybe an arrow from Lamb barely grazes him and he starts to panic so he rages, slashes that portray that he is fighting people and finally a missed opportunity that after a tussle with the Wolf, Trynd loses sight of him as he reappears behind him trying to pounce on him as Trynd looks towards Kindred reading her arrow but ultimately lowers her bow, as two frozen arrows pierce the veil and strike into the Wolf a.k.a the last two enemies.<br><br>In conclusion I still like the cinematic, but these are just some of the things in my opinion that could have been done differently.",1

2024-01-11T02:54:19Z,@pantsarehats7244,​@@monsay12 I am not 100% sure about this but. In lore it seems that Morgana&#39;s passion and resentment towards humanity have already did something to her ascendant ability. <br><br>But the most logical point here is Morgana got her Dark powers After she fought Kayle as she chose to live among humans and embrace the pain. But in this Cinematic Aatrox attacking Old Demacia or this is possibly just a Small village on the outskirts of the mountains near Demacia. This is quite interesting tbh as this is the first time we see Aatrox somewhere instead of Icathia. But this confused the timeline even more. Hopefully we get short story updates with each champion,0
2024-01-11T02:54:43Z,@brunomarques7713,@@monsay12 This is before they had their disagreement. Kayle believes in purity of justice (lawful in dnd terms). Morgana believes nuance is required to truly be just (chaotic in dnd but not really.). Kayle looks down on Morgana for that and takes Morgana&#39;s sword as she believes she is unfit to carry it. Also neither Kayle or Morgana are ascended. They are offspring of an aspect and each represent a side of justice. They are empowered here not ascended.,0
2024-01-11T03:02:49Z,@beanosfeed5414,"@@monsay12 You won&#39;t believe it but, basically the most cut and dry story. lol. Their mom was chosen to be the Aspect of Justice, she had twins.. They both had the powers, Morgana cares about criminals redeeming themselves and Kayle is a try hard, super cop. They both had a following of people and sooner or later they clashed. Which led to Morgana killing Kayles most devout follower. So her and Kayle decided to sky fight and then smoked their own dad who was below them. So Morgana peaced out and Kayle stayed as a super cop. lol",0

2024-01-11T00:34:57Z,@fyrein2236,"​@@ProficientFace For those of you asking, their different approaches to justice caused a rift between them to the point they fought each other above the skies of the Demacia of old, which inadvertently caused the death of their father which is when Morgana cursed her celestial powers and saw them as a burden. She tried everything to cut or tear her wings off but never managed, so she chose instead to bind them with steel chains and walk along mortals. I think the cinematic is showing this symbolically by having Morgana cast down her mothers sword and not using her wings. <br><br>As for their different approaches to justice, Kayle&#39;s is obviously retributive justice meaning that she prefers to smite wrongdoers without a second thought. Morgana represents restorative justice, which means she prefers to try reconcile with wrongdoers and aid them, but still punish them; her chains are the main instruments of this as they cause the target to feel the pain of their sins intensely.",141

2024-01-10T23:25:33Z,@thytju-oe5iw,"Dignitaries Condemn the CCP’s Forced Organ Harvesting<br>During the opening ceremony, Ishibashi Rintaro, a member of the House of Representatives of the National Assembly and the deputy representative of the All-Japan Local Assembly of the SMG Network (Stop Medical Genocide--Society for the Study of Organ Transplantation in China), delivered an opening speech as the sponsor of the exhibition. <br><br>Mr. Ishibashi said that the purpose of this poster exhibition was to stop the ongoing organ harvesting and transplantation crimes in China. He said the primary victims are Falun Dafa practitioners, Uyghurs, Tibetans and other groups. The CCP treats them like criminals, and harvest their organs while they are alive.<br><br>“We SMG will never allow such a thing to happen,” said Mr. Ishibashi. “But the problem at present is that although the CCP’s human rights violations have become a matter of great concern, in Japan, many people still don’t have enough opportunities to know. This poster exhibition is of fundamental significance, and lets many Japanese understand the facts of live organ harvesting (by the CCP).”<br><br>He said that another purpose was to urge the Japanese government to enact laws on overseas transplants as soon as possible. It was also important to raise awareness of this issue in the medical community and the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.<br><br>Councilor Takehara Tetsu, member of Hiroshima Prefecture Assembly, said in his speech, that he would share the truth with everyone. “After viewing these artworks, my heart is very heavy, and I am more aware of our great responsibility. I think this is an opportunity for me to feel the weight of my responsibility, and I feel this from these works today,” Mr. Takehara said.<br><br>Councilor Ochiumi Naoya, member of Higashi-hiroshima City Assembly, said in his speech that he was shocked when he saw the wound represented by the currency symbol on the poster, “As a Japanese, I didn’t know about this (that the CCP harvests organs from living Falun Dafa practitioners). I hope that through the poster exhibition, more people will know about this matter.”",0

I have a different theory. <br>While the arrow is clearly of the Lamb it doesn&#39;t add up that the eyes would be red if that was Wolf. <br>As history likes to repeat itself:<br>What if Aatrox comes back but somehow ends up attacking Ionia? <br>He had an army behind him during the Kayle/Morg fight while attacking Ancient Demacia and the silhouette matches him. Those raiders could be his new army in the future. Perhaps the World is ending and Aatrox reached Ionia. <br><br>The following however is a far fetch:<br>MMO Storyline where we have to fight off the End of the World against Aatrox during a Darkin Uprising? Varus is in Ionia too. Could work.",0

However, there&#39;s an aspect that often casts a shadow over this experience: the behavior of certain players. While it&#39;s not everyone, there are individuals who detract from the enjoyment, pointing fingers at others instead of reflecting on their own actions. Despite this, the potential of the game&#39;s universe is immense.

Especially Tryndamere fighting Kindred in spirit while fighting the men in reality and Kindred&#39;s head tilt of intrigue at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHhqwBwmRkI&amp;t=3m30s"">3:30</a> almost curious or surprised Tryndamere is fighting off death so fiercely, and Kindred not loosing her arrow once she realizes it&#39;s not her time to take him yet since Ashe saves him, also Ashe&#39;s arrows piercing &quot;through&quot; the spirit realm and bringing the light of reality with them; very cool attention to details!",1587

2024-01-10T22:30:24Z,@AshenRaines,"@@AwkwardDreamer No problem! And just for some more background context, Tryndamere is known for basically being unkillable (his ult in the game is basically undying rage and his eyes turn red and he refuses to die from any damage for a time) and Kindred is the spirit duo of death essentially, Lamb is the archer whos death is quick and peaceful (meaning you accept death) Wolfs death is like this cinematic; it&#39;s brual, a hunt, a thrashing and gnawing ordeal (meaning you are running from or trying to refuse death, which typically for the average being is out of your control) so when these two opposites clash it&#39;s a spectacle to watch. That&#39;s what I find so good about the head tilt from Kindred because Tryndamere isn&#39;t just defending himself or trying to stop death he actually goes on the offensive and basically tries attacking death to prolong his own life since he refuses to die which would be very uncommon and intriguing to come across as the spirit of death. Very well written and portrayed here.",12

Wol&#39;f eyes are round like Lamb&#39;s and blue/purple. The blue arrow looks to me like Ashe ultimate as a transition to Trynda and her, lamb&#39;s arrows are way more thin and doesn&#39;t have the back feathers, its more like a line even in game. I feel like riot wouldn&#39;t make them look so different for them both to be Lamb&#39;s when we have closeups of Lamb&#39;s arrow and Ashe&#39;s arrow and Ashe&#39;s arrow looks way more like the arrow in Yasuo&#39;s transition, even more not really knowing lorewise that Yasauo dies there.<br><br>Maybe I am just thinking too much u-u Just wanted to leave here a bit of my opinion",0

They are so interesting as a manifestation of death, and I love playing them. Seeing them come to life in an animation of this quality is fantastic. Wolf looks divine and intimidating, Lamb&#39;s mannerisms are so great with their little head tilt, and seeing them outlined in the other scenes is also wonderful, showing they are at each death (seeing Wolf&#39;s eyes in the treeline made me absolutely giddy). And yet, despite this, them showing up was not the single greatest shock to me. No, during this cinematic, there was one singular moment that made me actually involuntarily speak up out of surprise. And those words were &quot;Ashe has PANTS!!!&quot; God bless, we&#39;ve waited for this day for so long.",1

Which is in my opinion the best cinematic that was ever made by Riot. Imagine this but instead, have short voice lines dubbed over like Aatrox screaming while clashing against Morgana and Kayle, Kayle scoffing at morgana when she binds Aatrox when she gave her that “look”, Kindred taunting Tryndamere as they are fighting. Like simple things like that would be cool to see, and like honestly bro we could do without the hype music, every cinematic feels the same it just looks better but I feel there isn’t much like cool character interaction as much idk maybe it’s just me.",0

Niewolnicy, których uwolniliśmy podczas potyczki z flotą Regan mówią o dziwnych pogłoskach dochodzących z Erathii. Podejrzewam, że ich opowieści mogą mieć w sobie ziarno prawdy. Na razie jednak muszę na własne oczy zobaczyć co wydarzyło się w królestwie mego ojca.<br>Fale oceanu pochowały wielu z tych, którzy polegli na jego brzegu ale dymiące ruiny Cloudfire powitały nas widokiem śmierci i zniszczenia. Nikt nie przeżył, pobojowisko powiedziało mi jednak wystarczająco wiele o rozegranej tu bitwie. Pomimo ogromu zniszczeń obecność minotaurów na polu bitwy sugerowała napad złaknionej łupów bandy ale oddziały, które dokonały takiego zniszczenia musiały być dobrze wyćwiczone i dowodzone silną ręką. <br>Winnymi pogromu musieli być władcy podziemi. Widać iż garnizon zamku spodziewał się ataku a pomimo tego został bezlitośnie wybity do ostatniego żołnierza. Wszystkie popełnione tu okrucieństwa napełniły moje serce gniewem. Sztandar Erathii musi wzbudzać respekt i strach wrogów, nikt nie może go bezkarnie poniewierać. Myślę o moim ukochanym Rolandzie i synu Nikolaju. Na jak długo będę zmuszona ich opuścić. Mój obowiązek jest jednak oczywisty. Królestwo mego ojca musi przetrwać. Erathia nigdy nie zostanie rzucona na kolana.",2

2024-01-10T18:59:08Z,@Ruben.tarigan,"It&#39;s been idk, like 3+ years for valorant? And there arent many bad cases for vanguard there. Why do people still give so much concerns about it?",0
2024-01-10T19:22:49Z,@theoriginalrgbmike,"@@Ruben.tarigan because it&#39;s not just a standard kernel level anti-cheat, it demands to be on since boot and it&#39;s a huge potential security risk. Also I regularly use Sandboxie and similar programs which uses the kernel and would risk either a ban or just shutting me out of the game.<br>I realize I might be a bit paranoid, but I honestly don&#39;t like the idea of Vanguard on my PC. I&#39;ve also read a good number of problems caused by Vanguard to drivers on peoples&#39; PCs, which is just another reason to steer clear of it.<br><br>I get why they&#39;re doing it, but I honestly don&#39;t trust it and it seems like an excessive countermeasure to a problem that, as an average player, has rarerly been an issue for me. I won&#39;t potentially compromise my PCs security to play a game, even if it really pains me to leave a game I invested so much in.",0

2024-01-10T18:19:30Z,@sunset6132,"Cool detail I noticed. Tryn&#39;s shoulder guard was shown to be fine before fighting Kindred but then shredded afterwards and even outside of the Kindred fight next to Ash, which supposedly came from the bite from Wolf at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHhqwBwmRkI&amp;t=3m31s"">3:31</a>. Now this could obviously just be from the group of people he was fighting before and Tryn just hallucinated fighting Kindred when he was just still fighting the same group. However, I like the idea more that Tryn literally fought Runeterra&#39;s actual concept of death, the grim reaper, to the point that it just gave up and left him be, badass.",0

Game accurate😂 also about trynda and kindred....<br><br>If you&#39;re wondering, Trynda wasnt really fighting kindred there. Kindred is death, he was dancing with death, fighting tons of enemies while ulting, second guessing if he can survive or die after the ult runs out. Then ashe comes along to help signifying that he survives, thats why kindred disappeared.... cuz she has good respo and helped her buff daddy before he dies😊😂",1

2024-01-10T17:53:40Z,@jordanmathenia1966,"So Tryndamere never actually fights kindred? At the beginning we see Trynd surrounded by soldiers and he starts to see lamb. Then we see past and future with lamb and wolf at each, and then we go back to the present with Trynd alone in the clearing. He fights against Kindred, but kindred only fades once the last two soldiers die, and in the final shot the clearing is full of dead soldiers. He was never fighting Kindred, he was fighting the clearing full of soldiers, but in doing so inadvertently fought off death. It&#39;s like Kindred kills through the actions of others. Quite interesting.",0

2024-01-10T17:42:26Z,@gokhundogactemur3062,Imagine Hugh Jackman playing as Tryndamere..<br><br>Edit; I have watched tryn parts like 30 times.<br>You can see that his eyes glows only when he starts the intention of attacking on kindred.<br>He passes the death and strikes  kindred. Kindred evades with a backflip and you can see on her head movement (she rolls her head on the side)that shes confused. Because she realises that this mans time hasnt come yet so she doesnt fire the last shot while ashe comes to resque.<br>Also the fact that first wolf attack was just a distraction wolf didnt want to attack he just leaped over tryn so kindred fires the first shot. The pact between kindred and death is kindred collects those who are going to die but if they refuse its wolfs prey now. Tryn doesnt want to die so he refuses the first arrow. Then wolf attacks and you can see kindred waiting with an arrow in hand she doesnt fire. Only when tryn attacks kindred she fires another arrow which tryn again refuses so he punches the arrow dodging it and then screaming. <br>So much detailing lore wise just within 10 seconds. Man I wish the game was this fun and fulfilling aswell..,1

2024-01-10T17:25:21Z,@LiveEndurance,"This Cinematic is a materclass in storytelling. That Tryndomere/Kindred scene is an simply amazing. So well thought out. Trynd isn&#39;t actually fighting Kindred so much as fighting the ring of soldiers around him shown in the opening scene - the kindred/trynd fight is more symbollic of death being there to reap him. Then when Ashe comes she is fighting off the soldiers (notice how she doesn&#39;t even notice kindred/her arrows go right by?) &#39;aka&#39; the immenent source of death, and so with no threat on trynds life any longer kindred no longer has a need to be there and reap him, Wolf and Lamb are gone. But it is trynds undying will that gets him through the fight long enough to prevail until Ash arrives. Again that&#39;s not just good cinemetography that&#39;s good writing and storytelling/building a universal lore. <br><br>Then there is the morgana/atrox/kayle fight. I&#39;m not super familiar with their whole lore, but just in that few seconds it&#39;s like Morgana is almost &#39;falling&#39; as an angel and pullihng out her dark powers to save her sister, because she doesn&#39;t do the whole chain enegery stuff until Kayle is thrown against the wall and is in mortal peril. It gives a lot of depth into understanding a characters motivation to sometimes the &#39;fall from grace&#39;, and shows that motivations (well written motivations) are not just &#39;bad guy/good guy&#39; but are fraught with emotional drive. The symbolism of her dropping her sword and dropping her helmet to draw on dark chains is very cool. And the look from Kayle to Morg as kayle walks by is excellently animated. very small things that make a difference to the &#39;feel&#39; from the viewer.<br><br>I think the only problem with the whole trailer is that no way some random raider guy would get that kick off on Yas.<br><br>Well done Rito and more importantly the individual people who made this product. Great story in just a few minutes. Happy 2024 people.",11

The lamb needs to attack first to give a &quot;peaceful&quot; death, but if the person refuse this arrow, then its the wolf&#39;s turn. Lamb can only watch because its a deal, one do not interfere in the others prey, but when Tryndamere attacks the lamb, is not about just another person to die, but a fight for life and then they fight together until Ashe came to the rescue.

2024-01-10T17:16:11Z,@artemhsxreiasidakhs8536,So I will break down the part with Trynda and Ash and the reason why it&#39;s so beautiful for those that don&#39;t know the lore. Kindred is known as the spirit that helps the souls go to the afterlife. If one accepts their death Kindred will guide them peacefully BUT if they decide to fight they have a choice kill Kindred and return that&#39;s where the wolf comes in so the cinematic shows Trynda is basically fighting death itself to survive aka Kindred and as we see when Kindred is ready to shout her final arrow she stops because Ash comes to save her hasband aka Trynda such a nice cinematic it almost makes me forget the last one ALMOST riot will need to do a bit more for me and most of us to forgive them,0
2024-01-10T17:27:06Z,@ShadowTeller,"I always thought it was more about how a person lived, not necessarily acceptance or not.  Cruelty, or violence, such ways were always taken by Wolf.  Kinder folk instead met Lamb in the end.  Acceptance helps make it a little more sense. I just imagined Kindred having a bit of karma to them, that man would either thrill at battling Wolf refusing to die easily to anything, or fear the savage taking when Lamb  is a kinder option or wish the loved ones they protect be taken by Lamb if they must be taken and not the savagery of Wolf.",0

2024-01-10T17:08:19Z,@DanielChizh,"Conflicting feelings.<br>On the one hand, the story of Tryndamere and Ash here is perhaps the best of all time in Riot cinematics. Emotions, combat, lore component - everything is beyond praise.<br>On the other hand, everything else looks like it was added later just to stretch out the time. Kayle and Morgana&#39;s fight with Aatrox is just getting up to speed and is already over. Yasuo&#39;s story is the same.<br>And most importantly, there is no sense of lore behind it, everything happens as if in a vacuum. There is no sense of stakes, no sense that this is all part of something bigger, some epic story. The plot of Tryndamere and Ash works without context - a warrior fights for his life and receives help from his beloved. The remaining stories, however, are much weaker without the world behind them.<br>Subjectively, I’ll also add that I didn’t like the choice of music, although in The Call and Awaken I was delighted with the accompanying compositions.<br>However, for my taste, this is one of the three best cinematics for the League of Legends, right after The Call and Awaken. Despite all the obvious flaws, Tryndamere and Ash&#39;s scene is the best we&#39;ve seen, and it steals the show.",0

It’s base on everyone’s ideas, people said that Tryn was fighting back real man, real enemy not Kindred-she’s just metaphor, another said that Tryn was truely fighting back Kindred, at least we can see that when Tryn is near death, he is fighting back the Death, even in reality or his vision of mind, he still there and refuses Death, maybe at lucky time like this sense, Kindred also got chance to shot Tryn, even Tryn was fighting off death against the Wolf, but then she put down the arrow cause Ashe still here, to rescue Tryn, the moment Ashe’s arrow come through Tryn, we can see it brings light to Tryn, means Tryn: “Not today Death”",0

If you notice carefully, at the beginning of the video the tryndamere is surrounded by soldiers, and the second time he appears, the dark magical forest indicates the arrival of Kindred. At that moment, Kindred are the concept of death that came to get Trynda, but in reality he is fighting against the soldiers that were around him, but conceptualized in the form of Kindred&#39;s wolf and lamb, and at the moment when Tryndamere&#39;s ultimate It would end when Kindred would release the arrow and kill him, Ashe saves him from the soldiers behind there who would kill him, so there was no one left to kill him at that moment, so the Kindreds, who are the concept of death, were although.

SInce Kindred is the ebodiment of death it makes sense that Trynds ult is kind of an afront to her work. Sort of like how the reaper is always waiting for everyone of us. Trynd reaches the end of the road and literally fights off death every time. Wolf and Lambmight have simply been just representations of the people he was fighting. But Ashes arrival staves off death one more time. And Yet again Trynd faces the &#39;reaper&#39; and survives.<br><br>I haven&#39;t been in league for awhile, mostly get stuff off my brother, but I kinda hope this isoficial lore for Trynd at some point. it would ground him with some kind idea, and Make kindred have a sort &#39;goal&#39; and presence in a way.",0

There was some really cool moments and the whole consistent metaphor of death with Kindred was well thought out. But the actual storylines in comparison with previous ones were meh and the scenes just seemed to climax and move on which made for a really disjointed full video. In previous cinematics all the plots/storylines came to a climax towards the end and this works much better than just cutting and restarting a new scene on each verse. <br><br>I would like to see if they used the same creative agencies they did in 2020-2022 and if not i would suggest they go back to them.<br><br><br><br>Once again not totally hating. Some of the imagery was crazy good. But it still feels like a little of a let down, if I&#39;m being honest. 🙃",0

If thats the case, he shouldnt see Kindred at all, since theres nothing to Hunt as long as hes immortal. This cinematik could take place before Tryndamere got his immortality from Aatrox. Hes not in his ult, he is close to death and fighting for his life. This would also explain why Kindred goes away, once Ashe shoots those 2 guys behind Tryndamere and hes no longer in any real danger . If he was in his ult and mortally wounded, Kindred shouldnt disapear once Ashe is there, because Tryndamere is still about to die from bleeding out",0

For us and Tryndamere he is fighting for his life against death (figuratively) and others around him just see him mowing down soldier after soldier. Then Ashe showing up at the end chasing away Kindred and finishing off the soldiers is <b>chef&#39;s kiss</b>,0

That would mean that Ashe had just altered the timeline and it wasn&#39;t supposed to happen. This would mean she had information from someone in the future no? I think because he was at death&#39;s door to begin with (low HP) kindred appears to take him out as his enemies through his vision, since he has the ability undying rage activated it just prolonged the fight whilst still fighting them. I Think it would&#39;ve been cool to see Tryndamere W, E and then Q and see Kindred vanish. IT WAS AN AMAZING CINEMATIC THOUGH HOOLLLYYY!",0

Yeah that might a more acceptable term for poeple, he&#39;s kinda tapping into blood magic  (which is basically darkin powers) already ain&#39;t it, so he&#39;s besically a sane darkin, although a bit bloodlusted at times. So what I&#39;m trying to say here, is him being darkin like if he gets an ascension, aka &quot;good darkin&quot;, I think I just didn&#39;t convey the message properly and you misunderstood my message (darkins can&#39;t be good, they&#39;re too insane that&#39;s why I put &quot;good darkin&quot;).",0

2024-01-10T16:39:12Z,@trimex7234,"Tryndamere&#39;s powers are probably somehow explained by his encounter with Aatrox, he&#39;s probably become able to use some amount of blood magic. <br><br>Also I don&#39;t think kindred is the strongest character in the verse since there are multiple spirits of death.",0
2024-01-11T02:52:16Z,@lockmoon7413,@trimex7234  you right with that there are multiple spirits of death as shown in legends of runeterra but we do know for a (almost) fact that kindred is the aspect of death as 1. They are theorised to be once the true aspect death before being split into 2 (the grey man) and 2. They are the main version of death in the freljord and ionia as shown in their cover story and the spirit blossom verse,0
2024-01-11T02:57:41Z,@lockmoon7413,"Anyway even if they arent the strongest thats why i put arguably as even if they arent the strongest, they are still able to beat gods (aatrox killed a god and the aspects have to bring the dead to the after life and if unwilling they take them by force. We know the gods are really prideful after aurolian sol so this would make sense). I do think fiddlesticks is still the strongest as fiddlesticks is the demon of fear and kindred is scared of the grey man, meaning that fiddlesticks still has power over kindred but im a fiddle main and am probably biased",0

Secondly, you can&#39;t run away from kindred and you can&#39;t fight them. The moment the soul is leaving the body they will come to collect it.

La muerte como tal es otro ser que llega cuando kindred determina como muere un ser (violento o piadoso)<br><br>Trynda ataca a la oveja pero no al lobo, del lobo solo se defiende:<br><br>-la oveja es la muerte por piedad o por enfermedad es decir la muerte natural. Recordemos que trynda está en el suelo en la cinemática, no sabemos cuánto tiempo lleva ahí, puede que se estuviera desangrando o tuviera una herida profunda en un órgano. La oveja dispara esperando darle fin a su vida pero trynda la ataca.<br><br>Porque el arco de La oveja se rompe?<br><br>-Porque trynda acaba de negar la muerte natural, el rompimiento del arco es simplemente la representación de &quot;desafío a la muerte&quot;.<br><br>Kindred pudo haber muerto por la espada?<br><br>-No, kindred está en otro plano y los únicos que pueden matarlos son unos buitres que no me acuerdo cómo se llaman, pero el punto es, kindred piensa que es inmortal (pero no lo es). <br><br>Entonces entra a atacar el lobo ¿Quien es el lobo?<br><br>-El lobo es la muerte violenta involuntaria, es decir, por ejemplo, una decapitación, aplastamiento etc etc. En la vida real serían los guerreros detrás de trynda, intentando matarlo con sus hachas y espadas. <br><br>Porque la oveja no dispara mientras ataca el lobo?<br><br>-Porque no puede, ya que no es una muerte por piedad.<br><br>Porque kindred desaparece cuando llega ashe?<br><br>-porque trynda ya no está en peligro y evadió a la muerte.",0

Tryndamere was fighting those other guys from the start. His fight with Kindred was a symbolic fight showing him denying death. Those other guys failed to kill Tryndamere thanks to Ashe. The reason kindred even appeared is because he was supposed to die. His ult came in clutch. JG rep Kindred feeding,0

2024-01-10T15:39:07Z,@Yura-BooksSpoiler,"І того це мало б бути частиною лора. Тобто маєм 3 різні часові частини:<br><br>1. В древності, ще до того як сестри посварились, Моргана і Кейл бились проти Атрокса та його армії фрельйордців. Невідомо хто переміг, але всі троє залишились живими. <br>2. В недалекому минулому, армія Атрокса напала на Триндаміра. (Або це бій проти іншого племені, уже після того як Триндамір став чоловіком Еш, бо по лору Еш і Тринда зустрілись через деякий час після знищення села Триндаміра, а не під час цього).  Він напівживий б&#39;ється буквально проти смерті в обличчі Кіндрет, доки йому на допомогу не приходить Еш. <br>3. В далекому майбутньому старий Ясуо б&#39;ється проти армії наворі (?) і в результаті знищує групу загарбників, але помирає від стріли. Я так розумію, від стріли тієї ж Кіндред.<br><br>Ну і в чому прикол? Навіщо такі різні часові відрізки без контексту? Раніше, коли виходив кінематик, то випускали й якесь оповідання, котре пояснювало хоч частину цього кінематика. Зараз нічого. В чому прикол? Залишили нас з купую питань, без жодної відповіді. Окей, так, виглядає круто, але конкретика де? Де обіцяне адекватне розширення лору? Як на мене, то весь цей ролик виглядає як один суцільний трейлер до одного серіала на купу сезонів, або як трейлер до трьох різних фільмів. <br><br>В цілому - не задоволений. Стільки чекали, а в результаті нічого.<br><br>Поверніть оповідання! Вони хоч якось двигали лор всесвіту, а тепер він просто застиг в часі!",1

2024-01-10T15:23:33Z,@internetgoat4831,"I love the depiction of Tryndamere fighting Kindred even though he wasn&#39;t actually fighting Kindred.<br>---<br>He was fighting those enemies at the start of the cinematic.<br>It was like a Metaphor or just a Creative Hallucination that depicts Tryndamere being on the verge of Death and is fighting Death itself refusing to die.<br>His rage drowned him making him see himself as fighting Death but seeing Ashe helped calm him down to realize that he is not meant to die yet and that allowed him to come back to his senses when he saw the arrows and Ashe at the end.<br><br>It&#39;s more likely that lore-wise Kindred actually showed up there but either way it still serves it&#39;s purpose whether it was metaphorical or literal, Death&#39;s presence was still in there.<br>---<br>Impressive Cinematic.",243
2024-01-10T15:27:49Z,@alanarunmavath6005,Seeing Ashe calmed his rage and fury. That is a massive development since when he came to join the Avorasans Braum literally had to sheild all his strikes to get him to calm down. Their marriage has come a long way from marriage of convenience.,12

I will totally buy the Lux Statue so I have something real to keep and treasure as I mostly play as Star Guardian Lux but it is pretty miserable when new players are forced out of the game because of the nasty people who play it and expect a certain standard from anyone who plays this game and report you for not knowing how to play to their desires or standards!!,0

I love the characterisation in every part, the way Morgana plummets from the light skies, the disdain in Kayle&#39;s eyes, the way Kindred are neither malevolent nor vincible, the blind fury of Aatrox.<br>I gasped when Lamb lowered their bow as Ashe&#39;s arrows whizz past, the way Kindred doesn&#39;t take lives out of malevolence, and as Tryndamere is saved, it is not against them. The way Kindred are incorporeal, too much so, but it just makes sense because they are inevitable, invincible, and yet not malevolent. <br>I love this trailer, and if it&#39;s any indication of RIOT&#39;s focus on the lore that they announced, we are in for some great pieces.",255

Lo que hace especial a trynda es que la puede evadir, pero va a llegar porque todos van para allá, incluyendo al mismo kindred. Bueno y porque lo salvó ashe que es su esposa.<br><br>No sé porque jasuo está tan viejo pero supongo que es porque van a cambiar la generación de los campeones, y lo de Kayle y Morgana es simplemente espectacular.

2024-01-09T15:37:47Z,@gabriel00760,"I think it&#39;s unfair to say season 2023 was bad considering how much riot gave us this year. Never League was this transparent, we got an amazing new mode and although the meta was bad at times it was pretty volatile. The start of the season was undoubtedly terrible with everyone believing riot just gave up on the game, but they really worked to compensate for that on the rest of the year. 2023 was infinitely better than 2022 imho, but oh well, it wouldn&#39;t be league of legends if the players weren&#39;t constantly bashing it.",23

If you just consider &quot;the call&quot; cinematic as the one for last season like I do and completely erase whatever last year&#39;s was from memory then 2023 was actually one of the best years for the game.<br><br>before last year, the thought was &quot;riot has nothing more to add to the game so we&#39;ll just play on the stale game till we get bored and leave finally with nothing to look forward to&quot; and the cinematic that is no longer in my memory definitely fueled that. But the amount of compensation and finally the end-of-season remarks got me hyped as heck again.",3
